    <p>Macular degeneration, often called Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), is an eye condition that affects the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp vision. It is a leading cause of central vision loss in older adults. Early detection and timely care with lifestyle changes, eye supplements, or treatments can slow progression and preserve sight.</p>
    
   <!-- Symptoms -->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Macular degeneration develops gradually. Symptoms include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blurred or distorted central vision</li>
    <li>Difficulty reading or recognizing faces</li>
    <li>Dark or empty spots in the center of vision</li>
    <li>Reduced color intensity</li>
    <li>Increased need for brighter light</li>

<!-- Types & Stages of Macular Degeneration -->
<section id="types_stages">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-layer-group"></i> Types & Stages of Macular Degeneration</h2>
  <p>Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is classified into two main types — Dry and Wet AMD — and progresses through different stages (early, intermediate, and advanced). Understanding these helps in early detection and treatment planning.</p>

  <h3>Types of AMD</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dry AMD (Atrophic):</strong> The most common type, where the macula thins over time due to accumulation of yellow deposits (drusen). Leads to gradual vision loss.</li>
    <li><strong>Wet AMD (Neovascular or Exudative):</strong> Less common but more severe. Abnormal blood vessels grow under the retina and leak fluids or blood, causing rapid central vision loss.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Stages of AMD</h3>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Intermediate AMD</strong></td>
        <td>Larger drusen, some retinal pigment changes</td>
        <td>Slight blurriness, need for brighter light for reading</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Advanced AMD</strong></td>
        <td>Significant retinal damage in Dry AMD or blood vessel leakage in Wet AMD</td>

<!-- Food & Supplements for Macular Degeneration -->
<section id="food_supplements">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-carrot"></i> Food & Supplements for Macular Degeneration</h2>
  <p>Diet plays a critical role in slowing the progression of Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Certain nutrients and supplements can protect the macula and support overall eye health. The AREDS2 (Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2) formula is widely recommended for AMD patients.</p>

  <h3>Best Foods for AMD</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Leafy Greens:</strong> Spinach, kale, collard greens are rich in lutein and zeaxanthin.</li>
    <li><strong>Colorful Vegetables:</strong> Carrots, sweet potatoes, red peppers provide beta-carotene and vitamin A.</li>
    <li><strong>Citrus Fruits & Berries:</strong> Oranges, blueberries, strawberries for vitamin C and antioxidants.</li>
    <li><strong>Nuts & Seeds:</strong> Almonds, walnuts, sunflower seeds with vitamin E and zinc.</li>
    <li><strong>Fatty Fish:</strong> Salmon, tuna, and sardines for omega-3 fatty acids (DHA & EPA).</li>
    <li><strong>Egg Yolks:</strong> Contain lutein and zeaxanthin in a highly absorbable form.</li>
    <li><strong>Legumes:</strong> Lentils, beans for low-glycemic complex carbs and zinc.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>AREDS2 Supplement Formula</h3>
  <p>The AREDS2 clinical trial recommends the following combination for slowing AMD progression:</p>

  <h3>Lifestyle & Nutrition Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Follow a Mediterranean-style diet with fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fish.</li>
    <li>Avoid processed foods heavy in trans fats and sugars which damage blood vessels.</li>
    <li>Limit alcohol and quit smoking to enhance supplement effectiveness.</li>
    <li>Take supplements consistently under the guidance of an ophthalmologist.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">⚠️ Supplements help reduce the risk of progression but cannot cure or reverse AMD. They are most effective in people with intermediate or advanced AMD, not in healthy individuals.</p>
</section>
<!-- Ancient Treatments -->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>
    Ancient medicine recommended herbal tonics, antioxidant-rich foods, and eye exercises for vision. Ayurveda proposed Triphala and ghee for eye support, while Chinese medicine used acupuncture and goji berries. Although these methods supported general eye health, they cannot cure AMD or restore lost vision.
