    <p>Stroke, also known as cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or brain attack, occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain is interrupted or reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. This results in rapid brain cell death. Timely recognition and treatment are critical to minimize brain damage and improve outcomes.</p>

   <!-- Symptoms -->
   <section id="symptoms">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
    <p>Recognizing stroke symptoms quickly is vital. Common symptoms include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sudden numbness or weakness in face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body</li>
      <li>Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech</li>
      <li>Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes</li>
      <li>Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination</li>
      <li>Sudden severe headache with no known cause</li>
      <li>Difficulty swallowing</li>
      <li>Loss of consciousness or fainting in severe cases</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- Causes -->
  <section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>Strokes mainly fall into two types with different causes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ischemic stroke:</strong> Caused by a blood clot blocking a cerebral artery (about 87% of strokes)</li>
      <li><strong>Hemorrhagic stroke:</strong> Caused by bleeding within or around the brain due to a ruptured blood vessel or aneurysm</li>
      <li><strong>Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA):</strong> A temporary blockage causing stroke-like symptoms that resolve within 24 hours</li>
      <li>Other risk factors: hypertension, smoking, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, high cholesterol, family history, and sedentary lifestyle</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Diagnosis -->
  <section id="diagnosis">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-stethoscope"></i> Diagnosis</h2>
    <p>Diagnosis involves rapid clinical evaluation and imaging:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Physical and neurological examination</li>
      <li>CT scan or MRI of the brain to identify stroke type and location</li>
      <li>Blood tests to assess clotting and organ function</li>
      <li>Carotid ultrasound to check for artery blockages</li>
      <li>Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram to detect heart abnormalities</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Precautions -->
  <section id="precautions">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Control high blood pressure and diabetes</li>
      <li>Avoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption</li>
      <li>Maintain a healthy weight and exercise regularly</li>
      <li>Follow a heart-healthy diet low in salt, saturated fats, and cholesterol</li>
      <li>Manage stress and get regular health check-ups</li>
      <li>Take prescribed medications for heart disease or clot prevention</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Treatment -->
  <section id="treatment">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Emergency & Medical Treatment</h2>

    <h3>Ischemic Stroke Treatment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Intravenous thrombolysis (tPA) to dissolve clots if given within 4.5 hours of onset</li>
      <li>Mechanical thrombectomy to remove clot in large arteries (within 24 hours in selected cases)</li>
      <li>Antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications to prevent further clots</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Hemorrhagic Stroke Treatment</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Control bleeding and reduce pressure in the brain</li>
      <li>Surgical interventions like clipping or coiling of aneurysms</li>
      <li>Medications to control blood pressure and prevent seizures</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>General Supportive Care</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Oxygen therapy</li>
      <li>Intravenous fluids</li>
      <li>Management of complications like infections or deep vein thrombosis</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="note">⚠️ Immediate medical attention saves lives and reduces disability. Call emergency services upon recognizing stroke symptoms.</div>
  </section>

  <!-- Rehabilitation -->
  <section id="rehabilitation">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-heartbeat"></i> Rehabilitation</h2>
    <p>Post-stroke rehabilitation focuses on maximizing recovery and independence:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Physical therapy to improve movement and muscle strength</li>
      <li>Occupational therapy to regain daily living skills</li>
      <li>Speech and language therapy for communication difficulties</li>
      <li>Psychological support for emotional health</li>
      <li>Social support for return to community and work</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- Natural Remedies -->
  <section id="natural_remedies">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies & Lifestyle Support</h2>
    <p>These complementary approaches can support brain health alongside standard treatment:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats (Mediterranean diet)</li>
      <li>Regular gentle exercise as tolerated</li>
      <li>Stress management techniques: meditation, yoga, deep breathing</li>
      <li>Omega-3 fatty acid supplements with doctor’s approval</li>
      <li>Avoid alcohol and smoking</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="note">⚠️ Natural remedies should never replace emergency care or prescribed medical treatments.</p>
