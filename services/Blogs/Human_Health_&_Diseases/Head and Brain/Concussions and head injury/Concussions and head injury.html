<p>Concussions and head injuries are forms of **traumatic brain injury (TBI)** caused by impacts, falls, or jolts that disrupt normal brain function. While many are mild and temporary, repeated concussions can lead to long-term complications including post-concussion syndrome and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Proper diagnosis, rest, and graduated recovery are vital to ensure brain healing and prevent permanent damage.</p>

<!-- Symptoms -->
<section id="symptoms">
<h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
<p>Concussion symptoms can appear immediately or hours after impact, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Headache or pressure in the head</li>
  <li>Temporary loss of consciousness</li>
  <li>Confusion or feeling “foggy”</li>
  <li>Dizziness, vertigo, and balance problems</li>
  <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
  <li>Blurred or double vision</li>
  <li>Light or noise sensitivity</li>
  <li>Memory loss, especially about the event</li>
  <li>Sleep disturbances and fatigue</li>
  <li>Irritability, anxiety, or depression</li>
  <li>Pupils of unequal size (emergency sign)</li>
  <li>Seizures or prolonged loss of consciousness (severe injury)</li>
</ul>

<!-- Treatment -->
<section id="treatment">
<h2><i class="fas fa-syringe"></i> Treatment Options</h2>
<h3>Immediate Care</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure airway, breathing, and circulation stability.</li>
  <li>Call emergency services if prolonged unconsciousness occurs.</li>
  <li>Avoid giving painkillers that thin blood (e.g., aspirin) immediately after trauma.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Medical Evaluation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>CT or MRI scan to rule out bleeding or swelling.</li>
  <li>Neurological and cognitive testing.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Recovery Management</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Physical and cognitive rest for 24–48 hours.</li>
  <li>Gradual reintroduction of daily activities under medical supervision.</li>
  <li>Neurorehabilitation for long-term cognitive or motor symptoms.</li>
  <li>Medications for headache, sleep, and anxiety as advised.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Complications</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Post-concussion syndrome (persistent symptoms for weeks)</li>
  <li>Second-impact syndrome (re-injury before recovery)</li>
  <li>Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (long-term brain degeneration)</li>
</ul>
</section>

<!-- Ancient -->
<section id="ancient_methods">
<h2><i class="fas fa-landmark"></i> Ancient & Traditional Healing</h2>
<p>In historical times, head injuries were treated with herbal balms, cooling compresses of sandalwood and turmeric, and enforced bed rest. Ancient medicine also emphasized spiritual recovery and limited sensory input (silence, dim light) to let the mind and body heal naturally.</p>
</section>

<!-- Natural Remedies -->
<section id="natural_remedies">
<h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for Recovery</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Omega-3 fatty acids (from fish oil, flaxseed) to support brain repair.</li>
  <li>Turmeric and curcumin for anti-inflammatory effects.</li>
  <li>Magnesium and vitamin B complex for nerve healing.</li>
  <li>Gentle yoga and breathing after clearance by a doctor.</li>
  <li>Adequate sleep and minimized screen exposure.</li>
  <li>Cognitive exercises and puzzles for re-training memory.</li>
</ul>
<p class="note">⚠️ Natural remedies support recovery but cannot replace medical treatment for brain injuries.</p>
