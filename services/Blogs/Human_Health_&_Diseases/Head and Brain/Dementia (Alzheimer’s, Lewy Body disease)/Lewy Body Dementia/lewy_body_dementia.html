    <p>Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) is a progressive brain disorder caused by abnormal protein deposits called Lewy bodies that affect brain chemicals impacting thinking, movement, behavior, and mood. LBD includes dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease dementia, both marked by cognitive fluctuations and movement symptoms.</p>

<section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Symptoms can vary widely, but core features include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fluctuating cognition with alertness and attention changes</li>
    <li>Recurrent well-formed visual hallucinations</li>
    <li>REM sleep behavior disorder — acting out dreams</li>
    <li>Parkinsonism symptoms: muscle rigidity, slow movement, tremors, and shuffling walk</li>
    <li>Autonomic nervous system dysfunction causing dizziness, blood pressure issues, constipation</li>
    <li>Memory loss and thinking difficulties, though memory may be less impaired early on compared to Alzheimer’s</li>
    <li>Sleep disturbances including excessive daytime sleepiness</li>
    <li>Mood disorders such as depression and anxiety</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<section id="causes">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
  <p>LBD is caused by accumulation of alpha-synuclein protein forming Lewy bodies in neurons, disrupting brain function.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Abnormal alpha-synuclein protein deposits mainly in cortex and brainstem</li>
    <li>Loss of dopamine-producing neurons causing movement symptoms</li>
    <li>Mixed pathology with Alzheimer’s plaques common</li>
    <li>Exact cause unknown, no definitive genetic cause identified</li>
    <li>Age and male sex are risk factors</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-children">
  <h3>Children</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>LBD is extremely rare in children and young adults.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-adults">
  <h3>Adults</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Typically affects adults over age 50, average onset between 50-85 years.</li>
    <li>Clinical diagnosis based on symptom combination and history.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-aged">
  <h3>Aged People</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>More common in elderly population.</li>
    <li>Progressive cognitive and motor decline worsens with age.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Preventions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>No known prevention; focus on early detection and symptom management.</li>
    <li>Manage cardiovascular risk factors to support brain health.</li>
    <li>Avoid medications that may worsen symptoms (certain antipsychotics).</li>
    <li>Maintain healthy lifestyle with diet, exercise, and cognitive activities.</li>
    <li>Regular check-ups with neurologists for monitoring progression.</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Medications</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine) may improve cognition and alertness.</li>
    <li>Parkinsonism treated with levodopa cautiously due to potential side effects.</li>
    <li>Antipsychotics generally avoided or used with extreme caution due to sensitivity.</li>
    <li>Antidepressants prescribed for mood symptoms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Supportive Therapies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Physical, occupational, and speech therapy for motor and communication support.</li>
    <li>Sleep disorder management.</li>
    <li>Caregiver education and psychological support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Research and Emerging Treatments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Investigations into alpha-synuclein targeting drugs.</li>
    <li>Clinical trials ongoing for symptomatic and neuroprotective therapies.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>Traditional brain health remedies, including herbal medicine, meditation, and balanced lifestyle were used historically to support cognition, but had no known effect on Lewy body pathology. Herbs like ginkgo and ashwagandha were valued for memory enhancement.</p>

<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for Lewy Body Dementia</h2>
  <p>Natural supplements and lifestyle changes can complement medical treatment by supporting brain and overall health.</p>

  <h3>Herbal and Nutritional Support</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Antioxidant-rich foods like berries, leafy greens, and nuts.</li>
    <li>Herbs such as turmeric, ginkgo biloba, and ashwagandha.</li>
    <li>Omega-3 fatty acids for neuronal integrity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Lifestyle Choices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Regular exercise, cognitive activities, and social engagement.</li>
    <li>Stress reduction through meditation and yoga.</li>
