    <p>Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection caused by the dimorphic fungus <em>Sporothrix schenckii</em>, commonly acquired through skin puncture wounds from plants, soil, or organic matter. It mainly affects the skin and lymphatic system, leading to nodular lesions that can ulcerate. This infection is often called "Rose gardener's disease" due to its association with thorn pricks.</p>

   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Sporotrichosis symptoms generally begin a week to a month after fungal entry, progressing through these stages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Small red papule or nodule at the puncture site</li>
    <li>Lesion enlarges and may ulcerate</li>
    <li>Development of chain of nodules or ulcers along lymphatic drainage (lymphocutaneous sporotrichosis)</li>
    <li>Localized swelling and sometimes tenderness</li>
    <li>Rare systemic symptoms in immunocompromised patients</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Causes -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>Sporotrichosis is caused by the fungus <em>Sporothrix schenckii</em> species complex, found in soil, plants, and decaying vegetation. Infection occurs following traumatic inoculation into skin:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Injury from thorns, rose bushes, splinters, or soil</li>
        <li>Occupational exposure: gardeners, farmers, landscapers</li>
        <li>Contact with infected animals (cats) in rare cases</li>
        <li>Usually enters through small cuts or punctures</li>
        <li>More frequent in tropical and subtropical climates</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-children">
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Less common but can happen via outdoor play injuries</li>
        <li>Usually mild lesions that heal faster</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-adults">
    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Most frequently seen in outdoor workers exposed to vegetation</li>
        <li>Hands and arms are common sites of infection</li>
        <li>Increased risk with immunocompromised conditions</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-aged">
    <h3>Elderly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Lesions may become chronic if untreated</li>
        <li>Immunosenescence can increase susceptibility to severe disease</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Precautions -->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Prevention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Wear gloves and protective clothing when handling soil or plants.</li>
    <li>Clean wounds immediately with antiseptics after skin injury.</li>
    <li>Avoid working barefoot or with bare hands in contaminated areas.</li>
    <li>Remove thorns and avoid rose bush injuries when gardening.</li>
    <li>Seek prompt medical advice for chronic or unusual skin lesions.</li>

<!-- Treatment -->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Antifungal Therapy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Itraconazole:</strong> Preferred treatment, taken orally for 3-6 months.</li>
    <li><strong>Potassium iodide:</strong> An alternative treatment, especially in resource-limited settings.</li>
    <li>Amphotericin B for disseminated or severe infections.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Surgical Treatment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Excision of localized lesions in combination with antifungals.</li>
    <li>Drainage of abscesses if necessary.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Supportive Care</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Wound care to prevent secondary bacterial infection.</li>
    <li>Follow-up after treatment to ensure complete resolution.</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Ancient Treatments -->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>
    Traditional remedies included topical applications of plant-based poultices, honey, and herbal concoctions to reduce inflammation and promote healing. Ayurvedic medicine often used turmeric, neem, and sandalwood pastes for fungal skin infections, although modern antifungal drugs are necessary for cure.

<!-- Natural Remedies -->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for Sporotrichosis</h2>
  <p>Natural remedies can help alleviate symptoms and support skin healing but must be used alongside medical treatment.</p>

  <h3>Supportive Natural Care</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Turmeric paste for its antifungal and anti-inflammatory effects.</li>
    <li>Aloe vera gel to soothe skin and aid repair.</li>
    <li>Neem oil for antimicrobial protection.</li>
    <li>Maintain a balanced diet rich in vitamins C and E to support immunity.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">Natural remedies are supportive and do not replace antifungal therapy for effective cure.</p>
