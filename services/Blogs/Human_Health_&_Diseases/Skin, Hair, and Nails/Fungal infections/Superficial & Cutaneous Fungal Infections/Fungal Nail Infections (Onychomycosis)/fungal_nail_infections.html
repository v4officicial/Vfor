    <p>Fungal nail infections, medically called Onychomycosis, are chronic fungal infections affecting fingernails or toenails. They often cause discoloration, thickening, and brittleness of nails, leading to discomfort or cosmetic concerns. This infection is usually caused by dermatophytes, yeasts, or non-dermatophyte molds.</p>

   <!-- Symptoms -->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Symptoms of fungal nail infections may develop slowly and include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>White, yellow, or brown discoloration of the nail</li>
    <li>Thickened or distorted nail shape</li>
    <li>Brittle, crumbly, or ragged nails</li>
    <li>Separation of the nail from the nail bed (onycholysis)</li>
    <li>Foul odor from the infected nail</li>
    <li>Pain or discomfort, especially when pressure is applied</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<!-- Causes -->
<section id="causes">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
  <p>Fungal nail infections occur when fungi invade the nail through tiny cracks or cuts. Common causative fungi and risk factors include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Dermatophyte fungi such as <em>Trichophyton rubrum</em></li>
    <li>Yeasts like <em>Candida</em> species (mainly in fingernails)</li>
    <li>Non-dermatophyte molds</li>
    <li>Warm, moist environments such as sweaty shoes or communal showers</li>
    <li>Injuries to the nail or nail diseases</li>
    <li>Diabetes, poor circulation, or weakened immune system</li>
    <li>Age over 60 years</li>
    <li>Walking barefoot in damp public places</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-children">
  <h3>Children</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Less common than in adults but possible due to exposure and nail trauma</li>
    <li>More often caused by yeasts rather than dermatophytes</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-adults">
  <h3>Adults</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>More common in toenails due to shoe use and trauma</li>
    <li>Risk factors include athlete's foot, diabetes, and immunosuppression</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-aged">
  <h3>Elderly</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Higher prevalence due to slower nail growth and circulation problems</li>
    <li>Often chronic and resistant to treatment</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- Precautions -->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Prevention</h2>

<!-- Ancient Treatments -->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>Traditional remedies for nail fungus included herbal pastes made from neem, garlic, or turmeric applied to nails. Sunlight exposure and soaking nails in vinegar or saltwater were also used to reduce fungal growth, though modern antifungal medications provide more effective and faster cures.</p>

<!-- Natural Remedies -->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for Fungal Nail Infections</h2>
  <p>Natural options can complement antifungal treatment by reducing fungal load and promoting nail health.</p>

  <h3>Supportive Natural Treatments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tea tree oil applied carefully for antifungal properties.</li>
    <li>Vinegar foot soaks to alter nail pH and inhibit fungi.</li>
