    <p>Histoplasmosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by inhaling spores of the fungus <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>. It primarily affects the lungs but can disseminate in immunocompromised individuals, affecting other organs. It's prevalent in areas with soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings.</p>

    <!-- Symptoms -->
    <section id="symptoms">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Symptoms vary from mild to severe, often resembling other respiratory illnesses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fever</li>
        <li>Cough, sometimes with blood</li>
        <li>Chest pain</li>
        <li>Fatigue and malaise</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Weight loss</li>

    <!-- Causes -->
    <section id="causes">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
      <p>Histoplasmosis results from inhaling spores of <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>. The fungus is common in contaminated soil, especially with bird or bat droppings. Risk factors include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Occupational exposure in farms, caves, or bird sanctuaries</li>
        <li>Disturbing contaminated soil or droppings</li>
        <li>Living in endemic regions like the Ohio and Mississippi River Valleys</li>
        <li>Immunosuppression (HIV/AIDS, organ transplant)</li>
        <li>Chronic lung disease</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="treatment">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe"></i> Treatment Options</h2>
      <h3>Antifungal Medications</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Itraconazole or fluconazole for mild cases</li>
        <li>Amphotericin B or itraconazole for severe pulmonary or disseminated disease</li>
        <li>Duration varies from weeks to months based on severity and immune status</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Supportive and Adjunctive Care</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Rest and supportive therapy for symptoms</li>
        <li>Monitoring for systemic dissemination</li>
        <li>Adjusting antiretroviral or immunosuppressive therapy in immune-compromised patients</li>

    <!-- Ancient Treatments -->
    <section id="ancient_methods">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
      <p>Historically, fungal lung infections lacked specific treatments. Herbal decoctions, herbal inhalations, and traditional remedies such as garlic, turmeric, and medicinal plants were used to bolster the immune response, but these do not substitute modern antifungals.</p>

        <li>Consuming immune-boosting foods rich in vitamins C and E</li>
        <li>Maintaining good hydration</li>
        <li>Garlic and turmeric as dietary supplements</li>
        <li>Herbal teas such as ginger and licorice root</li>
