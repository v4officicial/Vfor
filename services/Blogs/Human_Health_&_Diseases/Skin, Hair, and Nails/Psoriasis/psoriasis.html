  <div class="main_content">

    <p>Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition that accelerates the life cycle of skin cells, causing them to build up rapidly on the surface of the skin. This buildup leads to thick, scaly, and inflamed patches that can be itchy or painful. The condition varies in severity, from small patches to widespread inflammation, and often cycles through periods of flare-ups and remission.</p>

   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Psoriasis typically manifests as itchy, scaly patches on the skin. Common symptoms include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Thick, silvery scales or plaques on the skin</li>
    <li>Dry, cracked skin that may bleed</li>
    <li>Itching, burning, or soreness around affected areas</li>
    <li>Red patches covered with white or silver buildup</li>

<!-- Causes -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Overactive immune response causing skin inflammation</li>
        <li>Genetic predisposition — family history of psoriasis</li>
        <li>Stress or hormonal changes triggering flare-ups</li>
        <li>Skin injuries, infections, or burns</li>
        <li>Cold, dry weather or rapid climate changes</li>
        <li>Certain medications like beta-blockers and lithium</li>
        <li>Alcohol consumption and smoking</li>
        <li>Obesity and metabolic syndrome</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!--Ancient Treatments-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>In Ayurveda and traditional medicine, Psoriasis (known as “Kitibha Kushtha”) was addressed using herbal detox therapies, panchakarma, and lifestyle correction. Herbs like neem, turmeric, and guggul were used to reduce toxins and calm immune responses. Regular oil massage (abhyanga) and medicated baths were part of ancient treatments.</p>
