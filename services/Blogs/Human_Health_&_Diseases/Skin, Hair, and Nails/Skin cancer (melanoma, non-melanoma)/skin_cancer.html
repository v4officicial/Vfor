    <p>Skin cancer is the abnormal growth of skin cells, primarily caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure from the sun or tanning beds. It is grouped mainly into melanoma and non-melanoma types. Melanoma is the most dangerous form, originating in pigment-producing melanocytes, while non-melanoma includes basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, usually less aggressive but still harmful if untreated.</p>

   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Skin cancer symptoms vary by type but may include early warning signs such as changes in skin appearance and texture:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>New, unusual growths or moles that change in size, shape, or color</li>
    <li>Asymmetrical moles with irregular borders (common in melanoma)</li>
    <li>Scaly, red patches or open sores that do not heal</li>
    <li>Raised, pearly or waxy bumps (basal cell carcinoma)</li>
    <li>Rough, thickened patches that may crust or bleed (squamous cell carcinoma)</li>
    <li>Itchiness, tenderness, or pain at affected skin sites</li>
    <li>Darkening or spreading of pigment around a mole</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<!-- Causes -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>The primary cause of skin cancer is DNA damage to skin cells caused by UV radiation exposure. Risk factors include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Excessive sun exposure and history of sunburns</li>
        <li>Use of tanning beds and lamps</li>
        <li>Fair skin with less melanin protection</li>
        <li>Family history of skin cancer</li>
        <li>Having many or unusual moles</li>
        <li>Weakened immune system</li>
        <li>Exposure to certain chemicals like arsenic</li>
        <li>Age, as risk increases with time accumulated UV damage</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!--Precautions-->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Preventions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Limit direct sun exposure especially between 10 AM and 4 PM.</li>
    <li>Apply broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher regularly.</li>
    <li>Wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and wide-brimmed hats.</li>
    <li>Avoid tanning beds and artificial UV sources.</li>
    <li>Perform regular skin self-examinations to catch early signs.</li>
    <li>Seek dermatologist evaluation for suspicious moles or spots.</li>
    <li>Keep infants and children especially protected from direct sunlight.</li>
    <li>Use shade whenever possible during outdoor activities.</li>
    <li>Maintain a healthy immune system through balanced diet and lifestyle.</li>
    <li>Be vigilant about medication side effects that increase sun sensitivity.</li>
  </ul>

<!--Treatment-->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Surgical Treatments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Excisional surgery:</strong> Complete removal of tumor with margin of healthy tissue.</li>
    <li><strong>Mohs micrographic surgery:</strong> Layer-by-layer removal ensuring cancer-free margins, especially in facial areas.</li>
    <li><strong>Curettage and electrodessication:</strong> Scraping and burning cancerous tissue for superficial lesions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Non-Surgical Treatments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Topical medications:</strong> Chemotherapy creams like 5-fluorouracil, immune response modifiers like imiquimod.</li>
    <li><strong>Radiation therapy:</strong> Targeted radiation for inoperable tumors or patients unfit for surgery.</li>
    <li><strong>Systemic therapies:</strong> Immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy for advanced melanoma.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Emerging Treatments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Checkpoint inhibitors:</strong> Drugs that help immune system recognize and attack melanoma cells.</li>
    <li><strong>Targeted therapies:</strong> Medications directed at specific genetic mutations in melanoma cells.</li>
  </ul>

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Non-Melanoma</strong></td>
        <td>Surgical removal, topical treatments, radiation for certain cases.</td>
        <td>Usually good prognosis; slower growing but requires treatment to avoid disfigurement.</td>

<!--Ancient Treatments-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>Historically, skin cancers were treated with rudimentary methods including herbal poultices, cauterization, and plant-based applications. While these lacked scientific efficacy, some traditional herbs were noted for anti-inflammatory effects. Ancient medical practitioners often used natural resins and oils, but modern surgical and medical advances now provide effective cures.</p>

<!--Natural Remedies-->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for Skin Cancer Support</h2>
  <p>Natural remedies can support overall skin health and may complement conventional treatments but are not substitutes for medical care in skin cancer.</p>

  <h3>Supportive Home Care</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Consume antioxidant-rich foods such as berries, green tea, and leafy greens.</li>
    <li>Use topical applications like aloe vera, green tea extracts, and turmeric for skin support.</li>
    <li>Apply natural oils (e.g., coconut oil) to keep skin moisturized post-treatment.</li>
    <li>Avoid irritants and allergens that can worsen skin condition.</li>
    <li>Maintain good hydration and a balanced diet to support immune function.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Sun Protection</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use natural mineral-based sunscreens containing zinc oxide or titanium dioxide.</li>
    <li>Wear UV-protective clothing and hats during outdoor exposure.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Consult healthcare providers before using natural remedies in conjunction with cancer treatments to avoid interactions or side effects.</p>
