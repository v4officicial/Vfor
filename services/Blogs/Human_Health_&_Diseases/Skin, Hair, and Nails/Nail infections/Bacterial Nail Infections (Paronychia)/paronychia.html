    <p>Bacterial nail infection, medically known as Paronychia, is an infection of the skin around the fingernails or toenails caused by bacteria, primarily Staphylococcus aureus. It leads to redness, swelling, and sometimes pus formation near the nail fold. Prompt care is essential to prevent spread and chronic infection.</p>

   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Paronychia symptoms can develop quickly and include discomfort around the nail. Common signs are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Red, swollen, and tender skin around the nail</li>
    <li>Formation of pus or blister with yellowish or greenish discharge</li>
    <li>Nail discoloration or thickening</li>
    <li>Pain aggravated by touching or pressure</li>
    <li>Warmth and localized fever in the affected area</li>
    <li>Separation of nail from nail bed in severe cases</li>
    <li>Chronic cases show flaky or rough skin near nails</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<!-- Causes of infection -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>Bacterial paronychia is usually caused by bacteria entering the skin through small cuts or trauma near nails. Factors increasing risk include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Frequent exposure to water or wet environments</li>
        <li>Nail biting, picking, or trauma from manicures</li>
        <li>Damaged or torn cuticles</li>

<!--Treatment-->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Medical Care</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Warm Soaks:</strong> Soaking the affected nail in warm water 3-4 times daily helps reduce pain and swelling.</li>
    <li><strong>Topical Antibiotics:</strong> Applied in mild cases to clear bacterial infection.</li>
    <li><strong>Oral Antibiotics:</strong> Required for moderate to severe infections or spreading cellulitis.</li>
    <li><strong>Incision and Drainage:</strong> For abscess formation, a minor procedure to release pus may be performed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Chronic Paronychia</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Management includes antifungal treatment as fungal infection often coexists.</li>
    <li>Use of corticosteroid creams to reduce inflammation.</li>
    <li>Avoidance of irritants and moisture is critical for healing.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Home and Post-Treatment Care</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain nail hygiene and avoid trauma during healing.</li>
    <li>Use protective gloves when doing wet work.</li>
    <li>Keep nails trimmed and moisturized.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">‚ö†Ô∏è Persistent or worsening symptoms need immediate medical evaluation to avoid spreading infection or nail deformity.</div>

<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>
    Traditional treatments for paronychia involved herbal poultices such as turmeric, neem, and aloe vera to reduce inflammation and fight infection. Immersing fingers in herbal decoctions and applying oils like sesame or coconut were common. These remedies aimed to soothe pain and promote healing, although modern antibiotics provide faster resolution.

<!--Natural Remedies-->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for Paronychia</h2>
  <p>Natural remedies can complement medical treatment by easing symptoms and promoting skin healing.</p>

  <h3>Home Care Methods</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Warm saltwater soaks for 10-15 minutes help reduce swelling and clear infection.</li>
