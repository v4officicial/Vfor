    <p>Fungal nail infection, also called Onychomycosis, is a common condition caused by fungi invading the nail bed and plate. It leads to nail discoloration, thickening, brittleness, and sometimes separation from the nail bed. Proper diagnosis and treatment help restore nail health and prevent spread.</p>

   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Signs of onychomycosis develop gradually and include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Yellow, white, or brown discoloration of the nail</li>
    <li>Thickened, brittle, or crumbly nails</li>
    <li>Distorted nail shape or lifting of nail from nail bed</li>
    <li>Foul odor in some cases</li>
    <li>Separation of nail edge (onycholysis)</li>
    <li>Mild redness or swelling around nail</li>
    <li>Occasional pain or discomfort, especially when pressure applied</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<!-- Causes of infection -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>Onychomycosis is primarily caused by dermatophytes‚Äîa group of fungi that thrive on keratin in nails. Other fungi and yeasts may also cause the infection. Main causes include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Warm, moist environments favor fungal growth</li>
        <li>Walking barefoot in communal showers or locker rooms</li>
        <li>Minor nail or skin trauma facilitating fungal entry</li>
        <li>Weakened immune systems and diabetes increasing susceptibility</li>
        <li>Poor nail hygiene and prolonged exposure to wet shoes or socks</li>
        <li>Previous athlete‚Äôs foot infection spreading to nails</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-children">
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Less commonly affected, but can get infected via shared footwear</li>
        <li>Injuries or nail biting increasing risk of invasion</li>
        <li>Immune system development influences severity</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-adults">
    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Common in adults exposed to damp environments or communal areas</li>
        <li>Higher prevalence with age due to slower nail growth and circulation changes</li>
        <li>Occupational exposure to water or chemicals</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-aged">
    <h3>Aged People</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduced immune response and circulation increases fungal infections</li>
        <li>Thicker, slower-growing nails prone to fungal colonization</li>
        <li>Higher likelihood of chronic conditions like diabetes contributing</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!--Precautions-->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Preventions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep feet and hands dry and clean.</li>
    <li>Avoid walking barefoot in wet or communal areas.</li>
    <li>Wear breathable, moisture-wicking socks and well-ventilated shoes.</li>
    <li>Do not share nail clippers or footwear.</li>
    <li>Practice good nail trimming hygiene, cutting straight across.</li>
    <li>Treat athlete‚Äôs foot promptly to prevent nail spread.</li>
    <li>Maintain healthy immunity through balanced diet and exercise.</li>
  </ul>

<!--Treatment-->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Medical Treatment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Topical Antifungals:</strong> Applied directly to nails but often require long treatment courses.</li>
    <li><strong>Oral Antifungal Medications:</strong> More effective, prescribed for moderate to severe infections.</li>
    <li><strong>Nail Debridement:</strong> Trimming and thinning thick nails by healthcare professionals.</li>
    <li><strong>Laser Therapy:</strong> Emerging treatment option that targets fungal cells.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Home Care Tips</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep nails trimmed and clean.</li>
    <li>Wear breathable footwear and change socks daily.</li>
    <li>Use antifungal powders or sprays in shoes to reduce reinfection.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">‚ö†Ô∏è Early treatment improves chances of full recovery. Consult a dermatologist for persistent nail changes.</div>

<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>Historical remedies for fungal nail infections included the application of herbal extracts such as neem, garlic, and tea tree oil known for antifungal properties. Foot soaks with turmeric or herbal decoctions were common. These natural approaches helped reduce fungal growth and soothe nail discomfort before modern antifungals were available.</p>

<!--Natural Remedies-->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for Fungal Nail Infections</h2>
  <p>Natural remedies may help control mild fungal infections and support medical treatments.</p>

  <h3>Home Remedies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tea tree oil applied daily has antifungal and antiseptic effects.</li>
    <li>Vinegar soaks create an acidic environment unfavorable for fungi.</li>
    <li>Garlic with allicin compound inhibits fungal growth.</li>
