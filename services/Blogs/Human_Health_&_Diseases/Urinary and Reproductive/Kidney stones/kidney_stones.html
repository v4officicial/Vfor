      <p>Kidney stones are hard mineral deposits formed in the kidneys when urine becomes concentrated with minerals and salts. They can cause severe pain, urinary problems, and complications if they block urinary flow. Proper hydration, dietary modifications, and timely treatment are crucial to management and prevention.</p>
