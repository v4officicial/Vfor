    <p>Infertility is the inability of a couple to conceive after trying for at least 12 months of regular unprotected intercourse. It affects both men and women and can result from various factors affecting reproductive health. Early diagnosis and treatment significantly improve the chances of conception and successful pregnancy.</p>

<section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Infertility usually does not cause distinct symptoms but is identified after unsuccessful conception attempts. Possible signs or associated symptoms include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Irregular, painful, or absent menstrual periods (women)</li>
    <li>Abnormal sperm count, shape, or motility (men)</li>
    <li>Hormonal imbalances causing fertility issues</li>
    <li>Recurrent miscarriages or pregnancy loss</li>
    <li>Pain during intercourse or ovulation</li>
    <li>Underlying medical conditions affecting reproductive organs</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
  <p>Infertility can arise from a wide range of factors affecting either partner or both:</p>

    <li><strong>Female causes:</strong> Ovulation disorders, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, fallopian tube blockage, uterine abnormalities, premature ovarian failure</li>
    <li><strong>Male causes:</strong> Low sperm count or poor sperm motility, hormone imbalances, structural problems, varicocele</li>
