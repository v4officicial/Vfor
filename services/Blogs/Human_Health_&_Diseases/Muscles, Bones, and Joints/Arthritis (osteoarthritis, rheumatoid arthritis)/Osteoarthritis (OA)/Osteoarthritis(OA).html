    <p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative joint disease characterized by the breakdown of cartilage, leading to pain, stiffness, and impaired movement in affected joints. It typically affects weight-bearing joints such as the knees, hips, and spine, but can also involve hands and other joints.</p>

   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Osteoarthritis symptoms develop gradually and include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Joint pain that worsens with activity and improves with rest</li>
    <li>Stiffness, especially after periods of inactivity or in the morning lasting less than 30 minutes</li>
    <li>Swelling and tenderness around the joint</li>
    <li>Loss of flexibility and reduced range of motion</li>
    <li>Grating sensation or crackling sounds (crepitus) during joint movement</li>
    <li>Bone spurs or hard lumps around affected joints</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<!-- Causes -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>Osteoarthritis primarily results from mechanical wear and tear of cartilage but involves multiple factors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Age-related cartilage degeneration</li>
        <li>Joint injury or repetitive stress on joints</li>
        <li>Obesity increasing joint load</li>
        <li>Muscle weakness around joints</li>
        <li>Genetic predisposition for joint degeneration</li>
        <li>Abnormal joint anatomy or alignment issues</li>
        <li>Other joint diseases or inflammation accelerating cartilage loss</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Precautions -->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Prevention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain healthy weight to reduce joint stress.</li>
    <li>Engage in regular low-impact exercise (walking, swimming, cycling).</li>
    <li>Avoid joint injuries through proper body mechanics and ergonomics.</li>
    <li>Strengthen muscles around joints with targeted physical therapy.</li>
    <li>Use supportive footwear and assistive devices as needed.</li>
    <li>Avoid repetitive joint strain or heavy lifting without support.</li>
    <li>Stay hydrated and eat a balanced diet rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory foods.</li>
    <li>Regular medical evaluations to monitor joint health.</li>
  </ul>
