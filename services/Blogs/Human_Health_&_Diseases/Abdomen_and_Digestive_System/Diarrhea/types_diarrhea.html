    <h1>Types of Diarrhea: Acute, Persistent & Chronic</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="main_content">
    <p>Diarrhea is characterized by frequent loose or watery stools. Depending on duration and underlying causes, it is classified into three main types: <strong>Acute</strong>, <strong>Persistent</strong>, and <strong>Chronic Diarrhea</strong>. Understanding these types helps target appropriate treatments and manage symptoms effectively.</p>

    <section id="acute">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-ambulance"></i> Acute Diarrhea</h2>
      <p>Acute diarrhea lasts less than 14 days and is usually caused by infections (viral, bacterial, or parasitic), food poisoning, or medication side effects. It often resolves without complications if managed with proper hydration and simple dietary care.</p>
