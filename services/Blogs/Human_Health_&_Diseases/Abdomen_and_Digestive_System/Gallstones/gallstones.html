    <p>Gallstones are hardened deposits that form in the gallbladder, a small organ located beneath the liver. They can vary in size and may cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, jaundice, or even blockages in bile ducts. While some gallstones remain silent, others can lead to complications requiring surgery or medical intervention.</p>
   
   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Gallstone disease or cholelithiasis may present with sudden biliary colic or remain asymptomatic. Common symptoms include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sharp, sudden pain in the upper right abdomen or center of abdomen</li>
    <li>Pain radiating to shoulder or back</li>
    <li>Nausea and vomiting, especially after fatty meals</li>
    <li>Indigestion, bloating, or burping</li>
    <li>Yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice)</li>
    <li>Fever and chills if infection develops (cholecystitis)</li>
    <li>Clay-colored stools or dark urine</li>
    <li>Acid reflux and discomfort after eating rich foods</li>
  </ul>
  <img src="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/-/scassets/images/org/gastro-digestive/gallstones">
</section>

<!-- Causes of disease -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>Gallstones form when substances in bile—like cholesterol, bile salts, or bilirubin—become imbalanced and form crystals that harden into stones.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Excess cholesterol in bile leading to stone formation</li>
        <li>High bilirubin production from liver diseases, infections, or hemolytic conditions</li>
        <li>Poor gallbladder emptying or sluggish digestion</li>
        <li>Obesity, diabetes, and high-fat, low-fiber diet</li>
        <li>Rapid weight loss or fasting</li>
        <li>Pregnancy and hormonal changes (especially high estrogen)</li>
        <li>Family history of gallstones (genetic predisposition)</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Causes by Age Group -->
<section id="causes-children">
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rare but possible in children with blood disorders like sickle cell anemia</li>
        <li>May develop due to obesity or high fatty diet</li>
        <li>Symptoms: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, jaundice</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-adults">
    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Most common in adults aged 30–60</li>

        <li>Excessive cholesterol-rich diet and lack of fiber</li>
        <li>Complications include gallbladder inflammation, bile duct obstruction, and pancreatitis</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-aged">
    <h3>Aged People</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Common in elderly due to reduced gallbladder motility</li>
        <li>Symptoms may mimic other abdominal conditions</li>
        <li>High risk of severe infection or gallbladder gangrene if untreated</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!--Precautions-->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Preventions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain a balanced diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol.</li>
    <li>Eat fiber-rich foods including vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.</li>
    <li>Avoid skipping meals or prolonged fasting to maintain regular bile flow.</li>
    <li>Engage in regular physical exercise to prevent obesity.</li>
    <li>Manage weight safely, avoiding rapid weight loss programs.</li>
    <li>Avoid heavy, greasy, or fried foods that can trigger gallstone symptoms.</li>

<!--Treatement-->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Surgical Treatment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy:</strong> Minimally invasive procedure to remove gallbladder. Most common and safest option.</li>
    <li><strong>Open cholecystectomy:</strong> Required in severe or complicated gallbladder disease.</li>
    <li>Surgery prevents recurrence since gallbladder is removed entirely.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Non-Surgical Treatments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Bile acid medications (ursodiol) to dissolve small gallstones (slow, may take months or years).</li>
    <li>Shock wave therapy (lithotripsy) to break up stones (rarely used today).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Complication Management</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Treatment of bile duct blockage with ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography).</li>
    <li>Antibiotics if infection occurs.</li>
    <li>Pain management with NSAIDs or acetaminophen.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">⚠️ Gallstones causing symptoms or complications usually require surgery. Untreated gallstones can lead to life-threatening infections or pancreatitis.</div>
</section>

<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>
    Historically, gallstone disease was managed with herbal concoctions, fasting, or physical remedies such as oil cleansing rituals. Ancient healers used turmeric, milk thistle, and olive oil preparations to stimulate bile flow. Though sometimes providing mild relief, these methods rarely dissolved gallstones and complications were common until modern surgical advances emerged.
  </p>
</section>

<!--Natural Remedies-->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for Gallstones</h2>
  <p>Although natural remedies cannot guarantee gallstone removal, some lifestyle and dietary practices may support gallbladder health and reduce discomfort.</p>

  <h3>Diet and Lifestyle Approaches</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Adopt a high-fiber diet with plenty of green vegetables, fruits, and whole grains.</li>
    <li>Drink lemon water or apple cider vinegar to stimulate bile flow.</li>
    <li>Olive oil with lemon juice traditionally used to assist digestion (though not proven).</li>
    <li>Green tea consumption for antioxidant and liver-supporting benefits.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Herbal and Food Remedies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Milk thistle supports liver and gallbladder function.</li>
    <li>Turmeric and curcumin help reduce inflammation in the bile system.</li>
    <li>Dandelion tea aids bile production and digestive function.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>⚠️ Critical Warning</h3>
  <p class="note">Natural remedies may offer temporary relief but cannot replace medical treatment. If pain, fever, or jaundice occurs, seek urgent medical attention as gallstones may cause serious complications.</p>
