<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>
    In ancient times, chronic constipation was managed using herbal laxatives such as senna, castor oil, flax seeds, figs, and prunes. 
    Ayurvedic methods included the use of Triphala powder, Abhyanga (oil massage), and Panchakarma therapies for regular detoxification. 
    Traditional Chinese Medicine used acupuncture, herbal teas, and pressure points to restore gut motility.
