        alt="Ulcerative Colitis Illustration">
    <p>Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes long-lasting inflammation and ulcers in the innermost lining of the colon and rectum. It is a chronic condition that often develops gradually and can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea with blood, fatigue, and weight loss. Proper medical and lifestyle management can help control flare-ups and improve quality of life.</p>

   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Symptoms of ulcerative colitis vary in severity and may come and go during flare-ups and remission. Common symptoms include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Bloody diarrhea (with pus or mucus)</li>
    <li>Urgency to defecate, often at night</li>
    <li>Abdominal cramps and pain</li>
    <li>Rectal pain and bleeding</li>
    <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
    <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
    <li>Fever in severe cases</li>

  </ul>

<!-- Causes -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>The exact cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown, but factors include genetics, immunity, and lifestyle behaviors. It is considered an autoimmune disease.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Overactive immune system attacking intestinal lining</li>
        <li>Genetic susceptibility (positive family history of IBD)</li>
        <li>Western diet high in refined sugar and red meat</li>
        <li>Stress and anxiety worsen flare-ups</li>
        <li>Gut microbiome imbalance</li>
        <li>Smoking cessation (unlike Crohn’s, quitting smoking may trigger colitis flare-ups in some cases)</li>
        <li>Environmental triggers such as infections or pollutants</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Precautions -->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Preventions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Adopt an anti-inflammatory, high-nutrition diet with fruits, vegetables, and low-fat proteins.</li>
    <li>Avoid trigger foods like dairy (if intolerant), high-fat, spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol, and deep-fried items.</li>
    <li>Stay hydrated — drink water and electrolyte solutions regularly.</li>
    <li>Take prescribed medication regularly during remission to prevent relapses.</li>
    <li>Manage stress with meditation, yoga, deep breathing, or mindfulness therapy.</li>
    <li>Regular physical activity for strengthening immunity and digestive regulation.</li>
    <li>Monitor symptoms and seek medical help at the first sign of flare-ups.</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Treatment -->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Medications</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Aminosalicylates (5-ASA):</strong> First-line drugs to control inflammation in the colon.</li>
    <li><strong>Corticosteroids:</strong> Used for acute flare-ups but not recommended long-term.</li>
    <li><strong>Immunosuppressants:</strong> Azathioprine, 6-Mercaptopurine to suppress overactive immune response.</li>
    <li><strong>Biologics:</strong> Anti-TNF therapies like Infliximab, Vedolizumab to block inflammation pathways.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Surgical Options</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Proctocolectomy (removal of colon and rectum) with ileostomy</li>
    <li>Ileal pouch–anal anastomosis (IPAA or J-pouch surgery)</li>
    <li>Surgery considered if medications fail or in cases of severe complications</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Lifestyle & Diet</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Low-fiber, low-residue diets during flare-ups</li>
    <li>Supplements for iron, B12, calcium, and vitamin D</li>
    <li>Balanced diet plan under medical supervision</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Ancient -->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Perspectives</h2>
  <p>
    Ancient healing systems like Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine described chronic diarrhea and intestinal inflammation as imbalances of digestive energy. Remedies included herbal formulations (like Triphala), rice gruel diets, yoga breathing, and stress control. Although not a cure, these approaches promoted digestive balance and comfort, some of which are now being studied as complementary therapies.
