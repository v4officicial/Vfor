        alt="Crohn’s Disease inflammation">
    <p>Crohn’s disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. It can affect any part of the digestive tract from the mouth to anus, though it most commonly impacts the small intestine and colon. Crohn’s is a lifelong condition, leading to recurrent abdominal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, and other complications without proper management. </p>

   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Symptoms of Crohn’s disease vary depending on the severity and location of inflammation. Common symptoms include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Persistent diarrhea, often bloody or with mucus</li>
    <li>Abdominal pain and cramping, especially after meals</li>
    <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
    <li>Chronic fatigue and weakness</li>
    <li>Fever and night sweats</li>

    <li>Mouth sores</li>
    <li>Joint pain and inflammation</li>
    <li>Eye inflammation and skin rashes</li>
    <li>Delayed growth and development in children</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Causes of disease -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>The exact cause of Crohn’s disease is unknown, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Overactive immune response causing inflammation of the digestive tract</li>
        <li>Genetic predisposition (family history of Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis)</li>
        <li>Gut microbiome imbalance</li>
        <li>Autoimmune dysfunction targeting gut tissues</li>
        <li>Western diet high in fat, sugar, and processed foods</li>
        <li>Smoking significantly increases risk and severity</li>
        <li>Environmental triggers such as pollution or stress</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Precautions -->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Preventions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Follow an anti-inflammatory diet rich in vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat options.</li>
    <li>Avoid trigger foods like spicy meals, alcohol, caffeine, dairy (if lactose intolerant), and processed foods.</li>
    <li>Quit smoking, as it worsens Crohn’s symptoms and flare-ups.</li>
    <li>Stay well-hydrated with water and electrolyte-rich fluids.</li>
    <li>Get regular colonoscopy check-ups to monitor disease progression.</li>
    <li>Practice stress management with yoga, meditation, or mindfulness.</li>
    <li>Exercise regularly for overall gut and immune system health.</li>
    <li>Take prescribed medications on time and avoid self-medication.</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Treatment -->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Medications</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Aminosalicylates:</strong> Reduce inflammation in intestines.</li>
    <li><strong>Corticosteroids:</strong> Short-term use for flare-ups.</li>
    <li><strong>Immunosuppressants:</strong> Azathioprine, Methotrexate to control immune activity.</li>
    <li><strong>Biologics:</strong> Anti-TNF drugs like Infliximab, Adalimumab to block inflammation.</li>
    <li><strong>Antibiotics:</strong> Used for abscesses or fistulas.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Surgical Treatment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Resection of damaged intestinal segments</li>
    <li>Strictureplasty to widen narrowed passages</li>
    <li>Fistula repair and abscess drainage</li>
    <li>Surgery is not a cure but can manage severe complications</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Lifestyle & Nutrition</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Adopt low-residue diets during flare-ups</li>
    <li>Use enteral or parenteral nutrition for severe malnutrition</li>
    <li>Regular vitamin D, B12, and iron supplements</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Ancient treatment references -->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Perspectives</h2>
  <p>
    Ancient medical systems like Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine described chronic intestinal disorders as imbalances of digestive fire (*Agni*) or qi flow. Treatments included herbal formulations, fasting, probiotic-rich fermented foods, and stress reduction techniques. While not specific to Crohn’s recognized today, these treatments emphasized gut healing and inflammation reduction. Modern integrative medicine sometimes combines these with clinical treatments.

<!-- Natural Remedies -->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for Crohn’s Disease</h2>
  <p>Natural remedies may reduce mild symptoms and support gut healing, but they should not replace medical treatment. Always consult specialists before use.</p>

  <h3>Diet & Supplements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Probiotics to balance gut bacteria</li>
    <li>Omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil, flaxseed) to reduce inflammation</li>
    <li>Turmeric (curcumin) for anti-inflammatory benefits</li>
    <li>Aloe vera juice to soothe digestion</li>
    <li>Vitamin D and calcium for bone health</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Herbal Approaches</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Peppermint and chamomile teas for gut relaxation</li>
    <li>Slippery elm and marshmallow root for intestinal coating</li>
    <li>Boswellia serrata extract for inflammation</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Lifestyle Practices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Yoga and meditation to reduce inflammation triggered by stress</li>
    <li>Regular low-impact exercise (walking, swimming)</li>
    <li>Adequate sleep to support immune regulation</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">⚠️ Natural remedies are supportive only. Crohn’s disease requires medical supervision.</p>
