    <p>Hearing loss is the partial or complete inability to hear sounds in one or both ears. It may develop gradually with age, occur suddenly due to injury or infection, or result from constant noise exposure. Hearing loss can affect communication, daily activities, cognitive health, and emotional well-being. Early diagnosis, proper treatment, and lifestyle adjustments can improve quality of life significantly.</p>

<!-- Ancient Treatments -->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>
    Ancient Indian texts suggest oil therapies like Karna Purana (medicated oil instillation). Ayurveda also used herbs like Ashwagandha for nerve strengthening. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, acupuncture was applied to specific ear and body points to restore auditory balance. Folk medicine included sound therapy with natural tones to sustain ear health.
