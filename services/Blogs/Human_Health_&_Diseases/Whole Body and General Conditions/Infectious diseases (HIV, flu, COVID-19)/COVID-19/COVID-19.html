The disease varies from mild to severe, with symptoms affecting the lungs, throat, and other organs. COVID-19 spreads via droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks, as well as from touching contaminated surfaces and then the face. Preventive measures and vaccines are key to controlling the pandemic.</p>

<!-- Ancient Treatments -->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>Before the discovery of the coronavirus, viral fevers were managed using herbal remedies, warm broths, inhaling steam with medicinal herbs, and yoga for respiratory health. Practices like drinking turmeric or ginger milk, tulsi, and pepper infusions were common for fever support but did not address viral infections specifically.</p>

<!-- Natural Remedies -->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for COVID-19</h2>
  <p>Supportive natural remedies can aid recovery but do not replace medical care or vaccines.</p>
