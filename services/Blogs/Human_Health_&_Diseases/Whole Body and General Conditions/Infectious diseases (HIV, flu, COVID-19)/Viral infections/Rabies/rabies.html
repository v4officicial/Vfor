      <p>Rabies is a fatal viral infection caused by the rabies virus, typically transmitted via bites or scratches from infected animals such as dogs, bats, and wild mammals. The virus affects the central nervous system, causing brain inflammation and, without urgent post-exposure prophylaxis, death. Rabies is preventable with timely wound care and vaccination.</p>
      
      <!--Symptoms-->
      <section id="symptoms">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
        <p>After exposure, symptoms usually appear 1–3 months later but can occur after weeks or years. Key rabies symptoms include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fever and headache (early symptoms)</li>
          <li>Fatigue, malaise, and anxiety</li>
          <li>At the bite site: pain, pins and needles, itching (paresthesia)</li>
          <li>Agitation, confusion, hallucinations</li>
          <li>Excessive salivation and difficulty swallowing</li>
          <li>Hydrophobia (fear of water)</li>
          <li>Aerophobia (fear of air drafts)</li>
          <li>Muscle spasms and paralysis</li>
          <li>Insomnia or altered mental status</li>
          <li>Eventually, respiratory failure and coma</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Causes -->
      <section id="causes">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
        <p>Rabies is caused by the rabies virus, transmitted via:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bite, scratch, or lick from rabid animals (dogs, bats, foxes, raccoons, etc.)</li>
          <li>Exposure to saliva through mucous membranes or open wounds</li>
          <li>Rare: organ transplants from undiagnosed rabid donors</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Human-to-human transmission is extremely rare. Unvaccinated pets and stray animals are common sources.</p>

          <li>Avoid contact with unknown, stray, or wild animals</li>
          <li>Educate children on safety around animals</li>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Treatment Options</h2>
        <h3>Urgent Post-exposure Prophylaxis (PEP)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Immediate and thorough washing of the wound with soap and water for 15 minutes</li>
          <li>Administer rabies vaccine and rabies immune globulin (RIG) as soon as possible</li>
          <li>Follow full vaccine schedule as per protocol</li>
          <li>Delayed or absent PEP almost always results in death</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Palliative Care (Once Symptoms Develop)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Supportive hospital care only; no cure after symptoms appear</li>
          <li>Manage pain, agitation, and respiratory symptoms</li>
          <li>Ventilator support as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pre-exposure Prophylaxis</h3>

      <section id="ancient_methods">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
        <p>In the past, rabies was misunderstood and managed with herbal applications, cauterization, superstitions, or ritual healing — none effective in preventing death. The discovery of rabies vaccine in the late 19th century revolutionized care.</p>

      <section id="natural_remedies">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for Rabies</h2>
        <p>No natural or home remedies prevent or cure rabies after exposure. Only timely wound cleaning and medical intervention (PEP) save lives. Herbal antiseptics or turmeric may be used with immediate wound washing before hospital visit, but must not delay medical treatment.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Cleanse bite area thoroughly with soap and water</li>
          <li>Apply antiseptic if available</li>
          <li>Seek emergency care without delay</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">Note: Rabies is always fatal without timely post-exposure vaccination — medical treatment is the only option.</p>
