    <p>Measles (Rubeola) is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the measles virus. It mainly affects the respiratory system and spreads through droplets from coughs and sneezes. The disease is easily preventable through the MMR vaccine and can cause serious complications like pneumonia or encephalitis if left untreated.</p>
   
   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Measles symptoms appear 7–14 days after exposure. Early signs often resemble a cold, followed by a characteristic red rash:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>High fever (often exceeding 104°F)</li>
    <li>Cough, runny nose, and sore throat</li>
    <li>Red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis)</li>
    <li>White spots inside the mouth (Koplik’s spots)</li>
    <li>Reddish-brown skin rash starting on the face and spreading downward</li>
    <li>Muscle aches and fatigue</li>
    <li>Sensitivity to light (photophobia)</li>
    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
    <li>Severe dehydration due to fever and rash</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Causes of disease -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>Measles is caused by the Rubeola virus, a member of the Paramyxovirus family. It is transmitted through respiratory droplets or direct contact with nasal or throat secretions of infected persons.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Airborne virus spread through coughing or sneezing</li>
        <li>Contact with contaminated surfaces or shared objects</li>
        <li>Weakened immunity in unvaccinated individuals</li>
        <li>Poor vaccination coverage in communities</li>
        <li>Malnutrition, especially vitamin A deficiency, increasing susceptibility</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-children">
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Unvaccinated children under 5 years are most at risk</li>
        <li>Vitamin A deficiency worsens measles symptoms</li>
        <li>Close contact in schools or playgrounds increases transmission</li>
        <li>Complications: ear infections, diarrhea, pneumonia</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-adults">
    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Unvaccinated adults can also contract measles</li>
        <li>Pregnant women face higher risk of miscarriage or premature birth</li>
        <li>Travelers to regions with low vaccine rates are more exposed</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-aged">
    <h3>Aged People</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Elderly with weak immunity can face severe complications</li>
        <li>May develop pneumonia, encephalitis, or long-term nervous system issues</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!--Precautions-->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Preventions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Get the MMR (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccine on schedule.</li>
    <li>Ensure children receive two doses for full protection.</li>
    <li>Maintain good hygiene and avoid contact with infected persons.</li>
    <li>Use masks and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.</li>
    <li>Improve nutrition, especially intake of Vitamin A.</li>

  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Medical Management</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No specific antiviral treatment exists; care focuses on symptom relief.</li>
    <li>Rest and hydration are crucial during recovery.</li>
    <li>Paracetamol or ibuprofen helps reduce fever and discomfort.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Vitamin A Therapy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Vitamin A supplements reduce severity in children.</li>
    <li>Recommended by WHO for all diagnosed measles cases under age 5.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Supportive Care</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Use humidifiers and saline nose drops to ease breathing.</li>
    <li>Maintain adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration.</li>
    <li>Isolation for at least 4 days after rash onset to prevent spread.</li>
  </ul>

<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>
    Historically, measles was often treated with herbal teas, rest, and cooling baths. Ancient physicians in India and China used herbal decoctions from neem, tulsi, and sandalwood paste to relieve rash and fever. These methods could soothe symptoms but lacked the power to prevent infection. Modern vaccination remains the only reliable prevention method.

<!--Natural Remedies-->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for Measles</h2>
  <p>Natural care can help support immune recovery during or after measles infection, but medical guidance is essential.</p>

  <h3>Diet and Lifestyle Approaches</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Drink fluids like coconut water, soups, and juices to prevent dehydration.</li>
    <li>Consume soft foods and avoid spicy or fried foods to reduce irritation.</li>
    <li>Take adequate rest in a dimly lit room to prevent eye strain.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Herbal and Home Remedies</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Neem leaves or turmeric paste can soothe itching from the measles rash.</li>
    <li>Tulsi and black pepper decoction may help ease fever and cough.</li>
    <li>Honey mixed with warm water and lemon supports throat comfort.</li>
    <li>Raw papaya and carrot juices provide antioxidant support.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">These remedies complement but do not replace vaccination or medical supervision.</p>
