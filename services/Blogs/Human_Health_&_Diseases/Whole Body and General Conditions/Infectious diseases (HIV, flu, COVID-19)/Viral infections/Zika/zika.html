      <p>Zika is a viral infection caused by the Zika virus, a mosquito-borne flavivirus mainly transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Zika infection is usually mild, but poses a special risk to pregnant women as it can cause severe birth defects like microcephaly in newborns. The virus can also be transmitted sexually or from mother to fetus.</p>
      
      <!--Symptoms-->
      <section id="symptoms">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Symptoms typically appear 3–14 days after exposure and are generally mild, lasting 2–7 days:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fever (usually low-grade)</li>
          <li>Rash (red spots, often starting on face and spreading)</li>
          <li>Joint pain, especially in hands and feet</li>
          <li>Muscle aches</li>
          <li>Conjunctivitis (red eyes, sometimes itchy or painful)</li>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
        <p>Zika is mainly transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, especially Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Transmission can also occur through:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sexual contact with an infected person</li>
          <li>Mother-to-child transmission during pregnancy or childbirth</li>
          <li>Blood transfusion (rare)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Outbreaks are common in tropical and subtropical regions.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>No specific antiviral treatment is available for Zika</li>
          <li>Rest and plenty of fluids</li>
          <li>Paracetamol (acetaminophen) to reduce fever and pain</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Prenatal screening for Zika exposure and fetal ultrasound monitoring</li>
          <li>Consultation with an obstetrician for suspected or confirmed maternal infection</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Severe Cases</h3>
        <ul>

      <section id="ancient_methods">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
        <p>Before modern medicine, mosquito fevers were managed with herbal decoctions, cool compresses, neem and tulsi (holy basil) infusions, and bitter gourd juice to lower fever. However, these did not target the actual virus or prevent complications.</p>

        <p>Natural remedies can support recovery but do not cure Zika. Always consult a doctor for diagnosis and management, especially during pregnancy.</p>
        <h3>Home Care & Support</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Stay hydrated: drink water, coconut water, and fruit juices</li>
