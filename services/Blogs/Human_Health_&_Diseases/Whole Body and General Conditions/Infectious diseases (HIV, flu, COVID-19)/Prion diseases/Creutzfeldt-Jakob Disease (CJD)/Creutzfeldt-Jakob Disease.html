    <p>Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is a rare, degenerative, and fatal brain disorder caused by abnormal prion proteins inducing brain cell damage. It leads to rapidly progressive dementia, motor dysfunction, and neurological decline. There is currently no cure, and most patients succumb within a year of diagnosis.</p>
   
   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>CJD symptoms typically progress rapidly, affecting cognitive and motor functions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Rapidly worsening dementia and memory loss</li>
    <li>Visual disturbances including blurred vision</li>
    <li>Muscle stiffness and involuntary jerky movements (myoclonus)</li>
    <li>Loss of coordination and balance problems</li>
    <li>Difficulty speaking and swallowing</li>
    <li>Personality changes, anxiety, and depression</li>
    <li>Seizures in advanced stages</li>
    <li>Coma and death generally within 6-12 months after onset</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<!-- Causes of disease -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>CJD is caused by misfolded prion proteins that trigger a chain reaction damaging brain tissue. There are several forms based on origin:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>sporadic CJD (most common):</strong> arises spontaneously without known cause</li>
        <li><strong>genetic CJD:</strong> inherited mutations in the prion protein gene</li>
        <li><strong>acquired CJD:</strong> rare, from exposure to contaminated brain tissue or instruments</li>
        <li><strong>variant CJD:</strong> linked to consuming contaminated beef products (mad cow disease)</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-children">
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>CJD is extremely rare in children but familial cases may occur.</li>
        <li>Early neurological symptoms can mimic other disorders.</li>
        <li>Genetic counseling recommended if family history exists.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-adults">
    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Typically affects people aged 60 and above.</li>
        <li>Sporadic CJD occurs worldwide with no clear cause.</li>
        <li>Risk increases slightly with medical procedures involving brain tissue.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-aged">
    <h3>Aged People</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Majority of CJD cases occur in elderly individuals.</li>
        <li>Rapid cognitive decline and motor impairment appear suddenly.</li>
        <li>Requires thorough neurological evaluation for diagnosis.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!--Precautions-->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Preventive Measures</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Strict sterilization of surgical and medical instruments to avoid contamination.</li>
    <li>Avoiding procedures involving brain or nervous tissue when unnecessary.</li>
    <li>Screening blood and tissue donors to prevent acquired cases.</li>
    <li>Public health measures to monitor and contain variant CJD outbreaks.</li>
    <li>Genetic counseling for families with inherited prion diseases.</li>
  </ul>

<!--Treatment-->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Treatment and Management</h2>

  <h3>Current Status</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No cure or effective treatment to stop or reverse CJD progression.</li>
    <li>Management focuses on relieving symptoms and improving quality of life.</li>
    <li>Medications may help control pain, muscle spasms, and psychiatric symptoms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Supportive Care</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Physical therapy to maintain mobility as long as possible.</li>
    <li>Speech therapy for communication difficulties.</li>
    <li>Nutritional support for swallowing difficulties including feeding tubes if needed.</li>
    <li>Psychological support for patients and families.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Research and Experimental Treatments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Investigational drugs targeting prion replication are under study.</li>
    <li>Immunotherapy and gene therapy approaches are experimental.</li>
  </ul>

<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Historical Perspectives</h2>
  <p>
    Prion diseases like CJD were not understood historically and were often misdiagnosed as madness or unknown neurological disorders. Traditional medicine had no specific treatments. Modern research identified prions as infectious proteins causing brain degeneration, revolutionizing understanding of these fatal diseases.

</section>

<!--Natural Remedies-->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural and Alternative Approaches</h2>
  <p>There are no proven natural remedies for CJD. Some complementary approaches aim to improve quality of life:</p>

  <h3>Supportive Practices</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Calming environments to reduce anxiety and agitation.</li>
    <li>Massage and relaxation techniques to ease muscle stiffness.</li>
    <li>Nutrition-focused care to support overall health.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">All alternative approaches should be discussed with healthcare providers and used alongside standard medical care.</p>
