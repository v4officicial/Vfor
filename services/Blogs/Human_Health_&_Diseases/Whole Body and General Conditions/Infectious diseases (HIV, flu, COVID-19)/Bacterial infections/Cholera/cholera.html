    <p>Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by *Vibrio cholerae*, spread through contaminated water or food. It can result in severe, watery diarrhea and rapid dehydration, posing a major threat during outbreaks in areas lacking clean water or sanitation.[web:67][web:64]</p>
   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Most cases cause mild or no symptoms; severe cases may progress quickly and require urgent hydration to prevent organ failure or death.[web:59][web:62][web:64]</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sudden onset of painless, profuse watery diarrhea (“rice-water stool”)[web:64][web:59]</li>
    <li>Vomiting, usually with clear fluid[web:62][web:64]</li>
    <li>Rapid dehydration: thirst, dry mouth, sunken eyes, low urine output, weakness[web:67][web:64]</li>
    <li>Muscle cramps due to electrolyte loss, leg or abdominal pain[web:56][web:59]</li>
    <li>Severe cases: circulatory collapse, shock, and death if untreated[web:64][web:59]</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Causes of disease -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>Cholera is caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with *Vibrio cholerae* bacteria. Outbreaks are common where sanitation is poor.[web:67][web:64][web:56]</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Drinking unsafe water (untreated, unboiled, contaminated by sewage)[web:67][web:65]</li>
        <li>Consuming raw or undercooked seafood, fruits, or vegetables washed with contaminated water[web:56]</li>
        <li>Person-to-person transmission is rare but can occur via contaminated hands or fomites[web:67]</li>
        <li>Poor hand hygiene and inadequate sanitation[web:65]</li>
        <li>Outbreaks after floods or natural disasters due to damaged infrastructure[web:67]</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Causes by Age Group -->
<section id="causes-children">
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>More vulnerable to dehydration and fatal complications; symptoms and fluid loss progress quickly[web:64]</li>
        <li>Malnourished or recently weaned children at highest risk[web:64]</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-adults">
    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Risk highest in travelers or residents of areas with poor sanitation[web:67]</li>
        <li>Underlying illness or older age can worsen outcomes[web:59]</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-aged">
    <h3>Aged People</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduced thirst response and frailty increase dehydration danger[web:64]</li>
        <li>Prompt fluid replacement, sometimes via IV in severe cases, is essential[web:64][web:59]</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<!--Precations-->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Prevention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Drink bottled, boiled, chlorinated or filtered water only[web:60][web:65]</li>
    <li>Wash hands with soap after bathroom use or before preparing food[web:65]</li>
    <li>Eat only thoroughly cooked foods; avoid raw salads, fish, and vegetables in high-risk areas[web:65][web:56]</li>
    <li>Peel fruits personally; avoid street food[web:56]</li>
    <li>Clean and disinfect food preparation surfaces regularly[web:65]</li>
    <li>Vaccination considered for people in high-risk zones or during outbreaks[web:67]</li>
    <li>Maintain hygienic toilets and safe sewage disposal[web:65]</li>

<!--Treatment-->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Rehydration Therapy (Mainstay)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS):</b> Mix clean water with prepackaged or homemade salts and sugars for fluid replacement; critical for survival[web:50][web:56][web:53]</li>
    <li>IV fluids for severe dehydration and circulatory compromise[web:63][web:53]</li>
    <li>Avoid sugary drinks; breast milk continues for infants[web:50]</li>
    <li>Zinc supplementation recommended for young children[web:50]</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Antibiotics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Used for severely ill or hospitalized patients to shorten the duration of illness; never a substitute for rehydration[web:50][web:56][web:53]</li>
    <li>Mass use not recommended to avoid resistance; selection depends on area resistance patterns[web:56]</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Comparison: ORS vs. IV Fluids</h3>

    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>ORS (Oral Rehydration Solution)</strong></td>
        <td>Widely available, effective for most cases, can be used at home[web:50][web:56][web:53]</td>
        <td>Slower rehydration for severe cases, requires ability to drink[web:56]</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>IV Fluids</strong></td>
        <td>Rapid correction in severe dehydration or shock; hospital setting[web:53][web:63]</td>
        <td>Needs medical supervision, IV access, and sterile fluids[web:53]</td>

  <div class="note">⚠️ Rehydration therapy is lifesaving; antibiotics support but do not replace ORS. Seek urgent care for persistent diarrhea and signs of dehydration.[web:50][web:56][web:53][web:64][web:59]</div>
</section>
<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>Historic remedies included herbal teas, ginger, coconut water, and broths to support fluid replacement before modern ORS; local plants and clove extracts were used for digestive comfort.[web:51]</p>

    <figcaption>Ginger, coconut water, and cloves have long been valued to help digestive symptoms in cholera outbreaks.[web:51]</figcaption>

<!--Natural Remedies-->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for Cholera Support</h2>
  <p>Natural methods complement, not replace, medical therapy like ORS and IV fluids. Some spices and probiotics show early promise in limiting symptoms.[web:54][web:51]</p>

  <h3>Diet and Lifestyle Approaches</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Homemade ORS: Mix ½ teaspoon salt and sugar in clean water, drink frequently[web:51][web:56]</li>
    <li>Coconut water and lime for hydration[web:51]</li>
    <li>Probiotic yogurt for gut support and recovery[web:51]</li>
    <li>Ginger, black pepper, mint, holy basil concoctions for digestive comfort[web:51]</li>
    <li>Clove, boiled in water, for regular consumption[web:51]</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Spices with Evidence Against Virulence</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Capsaicin in red chili, sweet fennel, and white pepper inhibits cholera toxin production (lab studies); reduces severity and risk of resistance[web:54]</li>
