      <p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, primarily affecting the lungs but can infect other parts of the body. TB spreads through airborne droplets when a person with active TB coughs or sneezes. Early diagnosis and rigorous treatment are critical to managing TB and preventing spread.[web:59][web:62][web:64]</p>
      
      <!-- Symptoms -->
      <section id="symptoms">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Symptoms differ between latent (inactive) and active TB. Active TB symptoms vary by site but commonly include:[web:59][web:62]</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Persistent cough lasting more than 3 weeks, sometimes with blood-tinged sputum</li>
          <li>Chest pain and difficulty breathing</li>
          <li>Unexplained weight loss and fatigue</li>
          <li>Fever, chills, and night sweats</li>
          <li>Loss of appetite</li>
          <li>Swollen lymph nodes, particularly in the neck</li>
          <li>Symptoms vary with extrapulmonary TB (kidneys, spine, brain)</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Causes -->
      <section id="causes">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
        <p>TB is caused by the inhalation of droplets containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis from an infected person with active pulmonary TB.[web:64][web:62]</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Transmission via airborne droplets from coughing, sneezing, or speaking close to others</li>
          <li>Close prolonged contact in crowded or poorly ventilated environments increases risk</li>
          <li>Immunocompromised individuals (HIV, diabetes, malnutrition) are at higher risk of progressing to active TB</li>
          <li>Latent TB infection remains asymptomatic but can reactivate when immunity wanes</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="causes-children">
        <h3>Children</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Often develop latent TB, with risk of rapid progression to active TB if untreated</li>
          <li>May have non-specific symptoms such as failure to thrive, cough, or fever</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="causes-adults">
        <h3>Adults</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Typical presentation includes chronic cough, weight loss, night sweats, and fatigue</li>
          <li>Risk factors include HIV infection, smoking, diabetes, and alcohol use</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="causes-aged">
        <h3>Aged People</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Higher risk of reactivation of latent TB due to immunosenescence</li>
          <li>May present atypically with less fever or respiratory symptoms</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Precautions -->
      <section id="precautions">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Prevention</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Early identification and isolation of infectious cases to prevent transmission</li>
          <li>BCG vaccination offers some protection in children</li>
          <li>Improve ventilation and avoid close contact with active TB patients</li>
          <li>Promote use of masks in healthcare or outbreak settings</li>
          <li>Screen high-risk populations for latent TB and treat as indicated</li>
          <li>Maintain good nutrition and manage conditions compromising immunity</li>

      <section id="treatment">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe"></i> Treatment</h2>
        
        <h3>Standard Treatment</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Antitubercular therapy (ATT) combines multiple antibiotics: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol typically for 6 months[web:62][web:64]</li>
          <li>Directly observed therapy (DOTS) ensures adherence and prevents resistance development</li>
          <li>Treatment for latent TB involves isoniazid or rifampin courses to prevent progression[web:64]</li>
          <li>Adherence and monitoring of side effects are critical to treatment success</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>MDR-TB requires prolonged therapy with second-line agents, often less effective and more toxic[web:64]</li>
          <li>Early detection and treatment are crucial to control outbreaks</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Supportive Care</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Nutrition, symptomatic relief (antipyretics, pain control), and monitoring of complications</li>
          <li>Psychosocial support and education for patients and families</li>
        </ul>
