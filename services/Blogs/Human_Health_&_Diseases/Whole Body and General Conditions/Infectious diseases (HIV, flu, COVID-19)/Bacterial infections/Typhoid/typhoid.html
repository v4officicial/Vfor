    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-children">
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Common due to weak immune systems and poor sanitation awareness</li>

        <li>Relapse possible if antibiotics are not completed</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-aged">
    <h3>Aged People</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Typhoid can cause severe complications like intestinal bleeding or pneumonia</li>
        <li>Weaker immunity leads to slower recovery</li>
        <li>Frequent dehydration and confusion symptoms</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Precautions -->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Prevention</h2>

<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Antibiotic Therapy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ciprofloxacin, Azithromycin, or Ceftriaxone</strong> are the most commonly used antibiotics.</li>
    <li>Treatment duration: 7–14 days depending on severity.</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Hospitalization</h3>
  <ul>

<!-- Ancient Treatments -->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>Historically, Typhoid was managed through herbal methods such as neem water, basil leaves, and turmeric milk. However, without antibiotics, mortality rates were high. Ayurvedic traditions used detoxification through herbs like *Guduchi* (Tinospora cordifolia) and *Tulsi*, believed to support immunity and reduce fever.</p>
