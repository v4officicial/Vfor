    <p>Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system, specifically the CD4 cells (T cells), which help fight infection. Left untreated, HIV can lead to Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). HIV is transmitted through bodily fluids and affects millions globally, but modern treatments allow people with HIV to live long, healthy lives.</p>
   
   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>HIV symptoms vary with disease stage:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Acute HIV infection:</strong> flu-like symptoms such as fever, sore throat, swollen glands, rash, fatigue</li>
    <li><strong>Clinical latency stage:</strong> often no symptoms; virus is active but reproduces slowly</li>
    <li><strong>Progression to AIDS:</strong> rapid weight loss, recurring fever, night sweats, prolonged swelling of lymph nodes, diarrhea, sores, pneumonia</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Causes of disease -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>HIV is caused by infection with the virus transmitted through specific body fluids:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unprotected sexual contact with an infected person</li>
        <li>Sharing needles or syringes</li>
        <li>From mother to child during birth or breastfeeding</li>
        <li>Blood transfusions with infected blood (rare, due to screening)</li>
        <li>Occupational exposure in healthcare settings</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-children">
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Primarily infected through mother-to-child transmission.</li>
        <li>Early diagnosis and treatment critical for survival.</li>
        <li>Access to antiretroviral therapy has improved outcomes significantly.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-adults">
    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>High-risk behaviors include unprotected sex and intravenous drug use.</li>
        <li>Awareness and regular testing help reduce transmission.</li>
        <li>Early detection allows prompt treatment to maintain health.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Aged People</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Older adults may present late with advanced disease.</li>
        <li>Comorbidities complicate HIV management.</li>
        <li>Continued prevention education is important across all ages.</li>

<!--Precautions-->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Prevention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Practice safe sex using condoms.</li>
    <li>Get tested regularly and know your partner’s HIV status.</li>
    <li>Use sterile needles and do not share syringes.</li>
    <li>Take pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) if at high risk.</li>
    <li>Ensure safe blood transfusions with screened blood.</li>
    <li>Pregnant women with HIV should receive antiretroviral therapy to prevent transmission to the baby.</li>

<!--Treatment-->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Antiretroviral Therapy (ART)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>ART involves a combination of HIV medicines that reduce viral load and prevent progression to AIDS.</li>
    <li>Effective ART allows people living with HIV to live long, healthy lives.</li>
    <li>Treatment does not cure HIV but suppresses it to undetectable levels, preventing transmission.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Supportive Care</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Regular monitoring of immune function and viral load.</li>
    <li>Manage opportunistic infections promptly.</li>
    <li>Psychosocial support for living with chronic illness.</li>
  </ul>

<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Historical Perspective</h2>
  <p>
    HIV/AIDS was first recognized in the early 1980s; initially considered fatal and untreatable. Over decades, medical advances led to antiretroviral drugs that transformed HIV into a manageable chronic condition. Awareness campaigns and prevention efforts remain crucial globally.

</section>

<!--Natural Remedies-->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Complementary Natural Approaches</h2>
  <p>Natural approaches support overall health but do not replace ART:</p>

  <h3>Nutrition and Lifestyle</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Balanced diet rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals supports immune health.</li>
    <li>Regular exercise, stress management, and adequate sleep enhance well-being.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Supplements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Vitamin D, B-complex, and omega-3 fatty acids may support immune function.</li>
    <li>Herbs like garlic and echinacea are used traditionally but should be discussed with healthcare providers.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">Consult healthcare professionals before starting natural supplements to avoid drug interactions.</p>
