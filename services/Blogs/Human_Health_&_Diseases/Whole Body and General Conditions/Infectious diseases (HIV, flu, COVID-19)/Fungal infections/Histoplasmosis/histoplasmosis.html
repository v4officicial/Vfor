    <p>Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by inhaling spores of Histoplasma capsulatum, commonly found in soil contaminated with bird or bat droppings. It primarily affects the lungs but can disseminate to other organs. The disease is common in certain geographic regions and can range from mild respiratory illness to severe systemic infection in immunocompromised individuals.</p>
   
   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Symptoms vary depending on the extent of infection and individual immune response:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fever, chills, and sweating</li>
    <li>Cough, sometimes with chest pain</li>
    <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
    <li>Shortness of breath in severe lung involvement</li>
    <li>Weight loss and loss of appetite</li>
    <li>Disseminated histoplasmosis may cause enlarged liver and spleen, skin lesions, and neurological symptoms</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<!-- Causes of disease -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>Histoplasmosis occurs after inhalation of fungal spores from the environment. Common causes include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Disturbed soil containing bird or bat droppings releasing spores</li>
        <li>Occupational exposures like farming, cave exploring, demolition work</li>
        <li>Living or traveling in endemic regions (Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, parts of Asia and Africa)</li>
        <li>Immunosuppression increases risk of severe disease and dissemination</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-children">
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Usually mild respiratory symptoms.</li>
        <li>Severe or disseminated disease uncommon but possible, especially in immunocompromised children.</li>
        <li>Early diagnosis improves outcomes.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-adults">
    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Higher exposure risk in occupational settings.</li>
        <li>Immunocompromised adults at risk for life-threatening disseminated histoplasmosis.</li>
        <li>Travelers to endemic areas should be aware of symptoms.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-aged">
    <h3>Aged People</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Greater susceptibility due to immunosenescence and chronic diseases.</li>
        <li>May experience more severe respiratory or disseminated infections.</li>
        <li>Require close monitoring and aggressive treatment.</li>
    </ul>

<!--Precautions-->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Prevention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid exposure to contaminated soil, especially in endemic areas.</li>
    <li>Wear masks and protective gear when disturbing soil or cleaning areas with bird/bat droppings.</li>
    <li>Employ dust control measures in occupational settings.</li>
    <li>Immunocompromised individuals should avoid high-risk exposure settings.</li>

<!--Treatment-->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Antifungal Therapy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Itraconazole is the drug of choice for mild to moderate histoplasmosis.</li>
    <li>Amphotericin B used in severe or disseminated cases.</li>
    <li>Duration of treatment varies from several weeks to months.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Supportive Care</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Oxygen therapy and respiratory support for severe lung involvement.</li>
    <li>Management of symptoms such as fever and cough.</li>
  </ul>

<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Historical Treatments</h2>
  <p>
    Before modern antifungal agents, histoplasmosis was often misdiagnosed and untreated. Traditional remedies for respiratory illnesses involved herbal decoctions and steam inhalation aimed at relieving cough and fever. These provided symptomatic relief but did not cure fungal infections.

<!--Natural Remedies-->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for Histoplasmosis</h2>
  <p>Natural therapies may complement antifungal treatment by supporting immune health and easing symptoms.</p>

  <h3>Immune Supportive Foods and Herbs</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Foods rich in antioxidants such as berries, green leafy vegetables, and nuts.</li>
    <li>Herbs like echinacea and elderberry reputed for immune boosting.</li>
    <li>Garlic and ginger may have mild antimicrobial properties.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">Natural remedies are supportive only and should not replace prescribed antifungal medications.</p>
