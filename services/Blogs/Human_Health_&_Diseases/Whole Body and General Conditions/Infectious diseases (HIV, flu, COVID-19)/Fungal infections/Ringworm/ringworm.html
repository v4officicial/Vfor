<!-- Causes of disease -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>Ringworm is caused by a group of fungi called dermatophytes that thrive on keratin in skin, hair, and nails. The infection spreads through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Direct skin-to-skin contact with an infected person or animal</li>
        <li>Fomites such as contaminated clothing, towels, brushes</li>
        <li>Warm, moist environments that favor fungal growth</li>
        <li>Swimming pools, locker rooms, and shared facilities</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-children">
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Scalp ringworm (tinea capitis) common in children.</li>
        <li>Easily spread in schools and playgrounds.</li>
        <li>May cause hair loss and scalp scarring if untreated.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-adults">
    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Body ringworm, athlete’s foot, and jock itch more common.</li>

        <li>Fungal nail infections more frequent in adults.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-aged">
    <h3>Aged People</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>More prone to fungal nail infections and skin breakdown.</li>
        <li>Reduced immunity or circulation contribute to infection risks.</li>
        <li>Often combined with other skin conditions requiring careful management.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!--Precautions-->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Prevention</h2>
