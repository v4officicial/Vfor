    <p>Malaria is a serious mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by Plasmodium parasites, transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It causes fever, chills, and flu-like illness and can lead to severe complications and death if untreated. Malaria is preventable and treatable with timely medical intervention.</p>
   
   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Symptoms typically appear 7 to 30 days post-infection and may vary by species:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>High fever with chills and sweating</li>
    <li>Headache and muscle pain</li>
    <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
    <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
    <li>Abdominal pain and diarrhea</li>
    <li>Anemia due to red blood cell destruction</li>
    <li>Jaundice in severe cases</li>
    <li>Seizures, confusion, and coma in cerebral malaria</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<!-- Causes of disease -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites transmitted to humans through bites from infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. The main species affecting humans include P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transmission via the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes</li>
        <li>Blood transfusion or shared needles (rare)</li>
        <li>Congenital transmission from mother to fetus</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-children">
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Children under 5 are at highest risk for severe malaria and death.</li>
        <li>Malaria contributes to high childhood mortality in endemic regions.</li>
        <li>Preventive measures such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are critical.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-adults">
    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Adults may develop partial immunity in endemic areas but can still get ill.</li>
        <li>Travelers to endemic areas are at risk without prior exposure or prophylaxis.</li>
        <li>Pregnant women face increased risk of severe disease and complications.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-aged">
    <h3>Aged People</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Older adults have diminished immunity, risking severe and complicated malaria.</li>
        <li>Underlying diseases can worsen infection outcomes.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!--Precautions-->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Prevention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) while sleeping.</li>
    <li>Apply mosquito repellents on exposed skin and clothing.</li>
    <li>Wear protective clothing to prevent mosquito bites.</li>
    <li>Eliminate mosquito breeding sites by removing stagnant water.</li>
    <li>Take prophylactic antimalarial medications when traveling to endemic areas.</li>
    <li>Community vector control programs using insecticides.</li>

<!--Treatment-->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Antimalarial Medications</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>First-line treatments include artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs).</li>
    <li>Chloroquine used in regions with sensitive parasite strains.</li>
    <li>Other drugs: quinine, mefloquine, atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline (prophylaxis).</li>
    <li>Severe malaria requires hospitalization, intravenous antimalarials, and supportive care.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Supportive Care</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Hydration, fever control, blood transfusions for anemia.</li>
    <li>Monitoring for complications like cerebral malaria or organ failure.</li>
  </ul>

<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>
    Historically, malaria was treated with herbal remedies such as quinine derived from the bark of the cinchona tree. Different cultures used various bitter herbs and fever-reducing plants. These natural treatments laid the foundation for modern antimalarial drugs.

<!--Natural Remedies-->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for Malaria</h2>
  <p>Natural remedies can support immunity and symptom relief alongside standard medical treatment.</p>

  <h3>Diet and Herbal Approaches</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Consume antioxidant-rich foods and maintain nutrition during illness.</li>
    <li>Moringa leaves and neem have traditional uses in malaria symptom management.</li>
    <li>Ginger and turmeric may reduce inflammation and support recovery.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">Natural remedies should complement, not replace, antimalarial medications. Consult a healthcare provider before use.</p>
