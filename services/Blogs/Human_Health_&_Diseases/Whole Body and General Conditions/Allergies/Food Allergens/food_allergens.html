    <p>Food allergens are substances in foods causing allergic immune responses in susceptible individuals. Food allergies range from mild symptoms to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Knowing common allergens, symptoms, and prevention helps manage food allergies effectively.</p>
   
   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Symptoms of food allergy may occur within minutes to hours after exposure:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Skin reactions: hives, itching, redness</li>
    <li>Swelling of lips, face, tongue, or throat</li>
    <li>Difficulty breathing, wheezing, or coughing</li>
    <li>Gastrointestinal symptoms: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain</li>
    <li>Dizziness, lightheadedness, or loss of consciousness</li>
    <li>Anaphylaxis, a severe and life-threatening reaction needing emergency treatment</li>
  </ul>

</section>

<!-- Causes of disease -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>Food allergies occur when the immune system mistakenly identifies harmless food proteins as threats:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Common allergenic foods: peanuts, tree nuts, milk, eggs, shellfish, fish, wheat, soy</li>
        <li>Genetic predisposition and family history increase risk</li>
        <li>Early exposure patterns and environment influence sensitization</li>
        <li>Cross-reactivity between related foods may trigger reactions</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-children">
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Allergies to milk, eggs, peanuts, and soy common in young children.</li>
        <li>Many children outgrow allergies to milk and eggs but not peanuts or tree nuts.</li>
        <li>Early introduction of allergenic foods under medical guidance may reduce risk.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-adults">
    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Shellfish and nut allergies are more common in adults.</li>
        <li>Food allergies can develop at any age.</li>
        <li>Oral allergy syndrome can occur due to pollen cross-reactivity.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-aged">
    <h3>Aged People</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Food allergies are less common but possible in elderly.</li>
        <li>Risk of severe reactions due to comorbidities and medications.</li>
        <li>Monitoring food reactions important in this group.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!--Precautions-->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Prevention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Read food labels carefully to avoid allergenic ingredients.</li>
    <li>Inform restaurants and caregivers about food allergies.</li>
    <li>Use allergen-free products and substitutes safely.</li>
    <li>Introduce allergenic foods early in infants as recommended by doctors.</li>
    <li>Carry emergency medications like epinephrine auto-injectors if prescribed.</li>

<!--Treatment-->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Immediate Management</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoidance of the triggering food allergen.</li>
    <li>Antihistamines to relieve mild allergic symptoms.</li>
    <li>Epinephrine injection for severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Long-Term Management</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Allergy testing to identify specific triggers.</li>
    <li>Oral immunotherapy under medical supervision in some cases.</li>
    <li>Education on recognition and treatment of allergic reactions.</li>

<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Historical Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Food allergies were not well understood historically and often attributed to food poisoning or spiritual causes. Traditional treatments involved herbal remedies for gastrointestinal symptoms. Modern immunology has advanced diagnostics, prevention, and management of food allergies.

<!--Natural Remedies-->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural and Supportive Remedies</h2>
  <p>Natural approaches may support immune health and reduce symptoms but are not substitutes for avoidance and medical treatment.</p>

  <h3>Immune Support</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Eating probiotic-rich foods to promote gut health.</li>
    <li>Consuming anti-inflammatory foods like turmeric and ginger.</li>
    <li>Stress reduction techniques to improve immune balance.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">Always inform your healthcare provider of any complementary approaches to avoid interference with treatments.</p>
