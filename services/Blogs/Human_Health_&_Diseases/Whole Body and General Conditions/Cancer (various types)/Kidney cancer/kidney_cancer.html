    <p>Kidney cancer, most commonly known as renal cell carcinoma (RCC), is a malignant growth originating in the kidneys. The kidneys are vital organs that filter waste from the blood and balance fluids. Kidney tumors can be discovered at an early stage or present as locally advanced or metastatic cancer. Early detection improves treatment outcomes.</p>
   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Kidney cancer may develop silently, with symptoms often appearing in advanced stages. Watch for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blood in the urine (hematuria) – may appear pink, red, or cola-colored</li>
    <li>Persistent pain in the back or side that does not go away</li>
    <li>Lump or mass that can be felt in the abdomen or side</li>
    <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
    <li>Fatigue and general weakness</li>
    <li>Loss of appetite</li>
    <li>Fever not caused by infection</li>
    <li>Anemia or low red blood cell count</li>
    <li>Swelling in the legs or ankles</li>
    <li>Night sweats</li>
    <li>High blood pressure</li>
    <li>Varicocele (enlarged veins in the scrotum, in males)</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Causes of disease -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>The exact cause of kidney cancer is not always clear, but certain risk factors and genetic conditions may increase the likelihood of developing the disease.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Smoking (major risk factor, doubles risk)</li>
        <li>Obesity (excess body fat increases kidney cancer risk)</li>
        <li>High blood pressure (hypertension)</li>
        <li>Family history of kidney cancer (hereditary syndromes like von Hippel-Lindau disease)</li>
        <li>Chronic kidney disease or long-term dialysis</li>
        <li>Exposure to certain chemicals (asbestos, cadmium, benzene)</li>
        <li>Advanced age (more common after age 50)</li>
        <li>Male gender (higher incidence than females)</li>
        <li>Previous radiation therapy</li>
        <li>Inherited genetic mutations and syndromes</li>
        <li>Unhealthy lifestyle: low fruit and vegetable intake, heavy alcohol use</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-children">
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma) is the most common kidney cancer in children</li>
        <li>Usually presents as an abdominal mass, pain, or blood in urine</li>
        <li>Genetic factors and certain syndromes (e.g., WAGR, Denys-Drash) increase risk</li>
        <li>Rapid diagnosis and treatment are crucial</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-adults">
    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Renal cell carcinoma is the most common type</li>
        <li>Risk factors: smoking, obesity, hypertension, chemical exposure, genetics</li>
        <li>Early-stage disease may be asymptomatic</li>
        <li>Advanced cases can spread to lungs, bones, brain</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-aged">
    <h3>Older Adults</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Incidence of kidney cancer rises with age (peak after 60)</li>
        <li>Delayed diagnosis due to vague or no symptoms</li>
        <li>Comorbidities may complicate management</li>
        <li>Emphasis is on regular checkups for early detection</li>
    </ul>

<!--Precautions-->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Prevention & Precautions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Avoid smoking; quitting tobacco significantly reduces kidney cancer risk.</li>

<!--Treatment-->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Surgical Treatment</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Partial nephrectomy:</strong> Removal of only the tumor and a small margin of healthy tissue, preserving kidney function if possible.</li>
    <li><strong>Radical nephrectomy:</strong> Complete removal of the affected kidney; may include surrounding tissue and lymph nodes if necessary.</li>
    <li>Laparoscopic or robotic-assisted surgeries are minimally invasive options.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Targeted Therapy & Immunotherapy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Targeted drug therapies (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors, VEGF inhibitors) block specific pathways in cancer cells.</li>
    <li>Immunotherapies (e.g., checkpoint inhibitors) activate the body's immune system to destroy tumor cells.</li>
    <li>Used for advanced or metastatic cases, or when surgery isn’t an option.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Radiation & Chemotherapy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Kidney cancer is often less responsive to traditional chemotherapy, but radiation is used for symptom control in advanced metastasis.</li>
    <li>Chemotherapy mainly for rare subtypes or as part of clinical trials.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Management of Complications</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Treatment of anemia or electrolyte imbalance may be necessary.</li>
    <li>Pain management and supportive care are crucial for advanced patients.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Postoperative Care</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Monitor kidney function regularly following surgery.</li>
    <li>Adopt a kidney-friendly, low-salt diet and remain hydrated.</li>
    <li>Routine imaging (ultrasound or CT) to monitor for recurrence.</li>
    <li>Attend all oncology follow-ups and screenings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Emerging Treatments</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Ablative techniques:</strong> Cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation for small or elderly patients not suitable for surgery.</li>
    <li>Participation in clinical trials for new drugs or procedures.</li>
  </ul>

<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Approaches</h2>
  <p>
    In ancient times, kidney tumors were not distinguished from other renal diseases. Herbal remedies, dietary restrictions, and massage or thermal therapies were used, but most cancers went untreated. It was only with modern surgical advancements in the 20th century that kidney cancer became treatable.

<!--Natural Remedies-->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural & Lifestyle Support</h2>
  <p>While there are no natural cures for kidney cancer, certain habits and foods support kidney health and aid recovery when combined with medical care:</p>

  <h3>Diet and Lifestyle Approaches</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Prioritize a diet rich in fresh vegetables, fruits, and high-antioxidant foods.</li>
    <li>Limit processed foods, red meats, and excessive salt.</li>
    <li>Stay hydrated with adequate water intake unless on fluid restriction.</li>
    <li>Include anti-inflammatory foods such as turmeric and ginger.</li>
    <li>Consume green tea and cruciferous vegetables; some studies show protective effects.</li>
    <li>Engage in regular moderate exercise to maintain a healthy weight.</li>
    <li>Avoid over-the-counter supplements unless prescribed by your healthcare provider.</li>
    <li>Manage stress with meditation, yoga, or relaxation exercises.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Herbal and Food Support</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Coriander, parsley, and garlic support detoxification but consult your doctor first.</li>
    <li>Ginger and turmeric may help combat inflammation.</li>
    <li>Black seed (kalonji) and amla are used in some traditional remedies, but evidence for cancer is limited.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Critical Note</h3>
  <p class="note">Natural remedies cannot cure kidney cancer. Medical guidance, early detection, and advanced treatment are essential for survival. Use lifestyle changes as a complement, not a replacement.</p>
