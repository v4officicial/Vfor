      <p>Prostate cancer develops in the prostate, a walnut-sized gland in the male reproductive system. Most cases occur in men over 50 and are slow-growing, but early detection is key for best outcomes. Screening with PSA blood tests and digital rectal exam can help find cancer early[web:66][web:69][web:70][web:72].</p>

        <p>
          Historically, prostate problems were managed with catheterization, bladder flushing, or herbal medicines for urinary complaints. True cancer treatment became possible only with modern surgical and radiation advances.
