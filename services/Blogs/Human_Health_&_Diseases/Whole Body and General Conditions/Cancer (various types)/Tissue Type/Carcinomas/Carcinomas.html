      <p>Carcinomas are cancers that originate in epithelial tissues covering the skin, organs, and lining of body cavities. They account for 80-90% of all cancer cases worldwide and include major subtypes such as adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and basal cell carcinoma. Carcinomas can develop in the breast, prostate, lung, skin, colon, bladder, and many other organs[web:84][web:85][web:87][web:88][web:90].</p>

      <!-- Types -->
      <section id="types">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-list-ul"></i> Types of Carcinoma</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Adenocarcinoma:</strong> Originates in glandular tissue of organs; common in breast, lung, colon, pancreas, and prostate[web:84][web:86][web:87][web:92].</li>
          <li><strong>Squamous cell carcinoma:</strong> Develops in flat squamous cells found in skin, mouth, esophagus, and lungs[web:84][web:86][web:87][web:93].</li>
          <li><strong>Basal cell carcinoma:</strong> Begins in the lowest layer of skin’s epidermis; commonly linked to sun exposure[web:85][web:86][web:87][web:91].</li>
          <li><strong>Transitional cell carcinoma:</strong> Affects cells lining organs with stretching capacity, such as the bladder[web:85][web:87].</li>
          <li><strong>Ductal carcinoma:</strong> Originates in ducts/channels, often in breast or pancreas (includes DCIS – ductal carcinoma in situ)[web:86][web:87][web:91].</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other rare variants include adenosquamous carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma[web:84][web:89].</p>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
        <p>Carcinomas arise due to mutations in epithelial cell DNA. Major causes and risk factors include[web:84][web:85][web:87][web:91][web:93]:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Chronic exposure to carcinogens (tobacco, alcohol, radiation, chemicals)</li>
          <li>Chronic inflammation (gastritis, colitis, hepatitis, etc.)</li>
          <li>Family history and hereditary gene mutations</li>
          <li>Age (risk rises after 50)</li>
          <li>Comorbid conditions (obesity, diabetes, viral infections, including HPV, HBV, HCV)</li>
          <li>Unhealthy diet, sedentary lifestyle</li>
          <li>Prolonged sun exposure (for skin carcinomas)</li>

        <h3>Children</h3>
        <ul>

        <h3>Surgery</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Curative for most localized carcinomas; type depends on organ</li>
          <li>May involve tumor removal, resection, or ablation</li>
          <li>Used for breast, colon, lung, skin, and bladder carcinomas</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Radiation Therapy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Targets and destroys cancer cells in specific areas</li>
          <li>Used in both early-stage and palliative settings</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Systemic drugs to kill or slow cancer spread</li>
          <li>Used for advanced or metastatic carcinoma</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>Specific drugs attack unique cancer cell markers</li>
          <li>Immunotherapy stimulates the immune response to cancer cells</li>
          <li>Key in treating advanced adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and others</li>
