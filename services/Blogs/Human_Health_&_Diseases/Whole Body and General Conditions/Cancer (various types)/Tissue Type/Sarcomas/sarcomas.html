      <p>
        Sarcomas are a rare group of cancers that arise from connective tissues such as fat, muscle, nerves, bones, and cartilage. They are broadly classified into soft tissue sarcomas and bone sarcomas with over 70 subtypes. Timely diagnosis and advanced treatments including surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy improve outcomes[web:84][web:90].

        <h3>Surgery</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Primary treatment aimed at complete tumor removal</li>
          <li>Often combined with radiation or chemotherapy for better outcomes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Radiation Therapy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Used pre- or postoperatively to reduce recurrence</li>
          <li>Also a palliative option to relieve symptoms in inoperable cases</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Effective against some sarcoma subtypes (e.g., Ewing sarcoma)</li>
          <li>Used in advanced, metastatic or high-grade tumors</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Targeted Therapy & Immunotherapy</h3>
        <ul>

        <p>
          Ancient medicine treated skin lumps and swellings with herbal poultices, cauterization, and simple excisions. Awareness of sarcomas as distinct cancers emerged only with modern pathology and surgery.
