    <p>Breast cancer is a malignant tumor that develops from breast cells. It is the most common cancer in women worldwide and can also occur in men. Early detection through screening and advances in treatment have improved survival rates significantly.</p>
   
   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Common breast cancer symptoms include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A lump or thickening in the breast or underarm</li>
    <li>Change in breast size, shape, or appearance</li>
    <li>Skin changes such as dimpling or redness</li>
    <li>Nipple discharge other than breast milk</li>

</section>

<!-- Causes & Risk Factors -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes & Risk Factors</h2>
    <p>Breast cancer is caused by genetic mutations leading to uncontrolled cell growth. Risk factors include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Age – risk increases with age</li>
        <li>Family history of breast or ovarian cancer</li>
        <li>Inherited gene mutations (BRCA1, BRCA2)</li>
        <li>Hormonal factors like early menstruation, late menopause, hormone therapy</li>
        <li>Obesity, alcohol consumption, and radiation exposure</li>
        <li>Reproductive history including late or no pregnancy</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Precautions & Prevention -->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions & Prevention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Regular breast self-exams and clinical exams.</li>
    <li>Routine mammography screening as recommended by healthcare providers.</li>
    <li>Healthy diet, maintaining ideal weight, and regular exercise.</li>
    <li>Limiting alcohol intake and avoiding tobacco.</li>
    <li>Discussing family history with doctor and genetic counseling if needed.</li>
  </ul>

<!--Treatment Options-->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

  <h3>Surgery</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Lumpectomy to remove tumor and some surrounding tissue.</li>
    <li>Mastectomy to remove part or all of the breast.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Radiation Therapy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>High-energy rays to kill remaining cancer cells after surgery.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Drugs to kill cancer cells or stop their growth.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Hormone Therapy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Used for hormone receptor-positive breast cancers to block hormones stimulating growth.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Targeted Therapy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Drugs targeting specific molecules involved in cancer growth, e.g., HER2 inhibitors.</li>
  </ul>

<!--Historical Overview-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Historical Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Breast cancer was described in ancient medical texts, though early treatments were limited to surgical removal and herbal remedies. In modern times, advances in biology and medicine have transformed treatment with multi-modality approaches improving outcomes and survival.

<!--Natural Supports-->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Supports for Breast Cancer</h2>
  <p>Natural and supportive approaches complement medical treatment:</p>

  <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>High intake of fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.</li>
    <li>Maintain healthy weight through balanced diet and exercise.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Mind-Body Support</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Stress reduction techniques such as meditation, yoga, and acupuncture.</li>
    <li>Psychological counseling for coping and emotional support.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">All natural therapies should be discussed with oncologists to ensure safety and avoid interaction with treatments.</p>
