      <p>Leukemia is a group of cancers that originate in the blood-forming tissues, primarily the bone marrow and lymphatic system. It leads to the uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal white blood cells, which crowd out healthy cells, impairing the immune system and blood function. Leukemia can be acute or chronic and affects both children and adults.</p>
      <!--Symptoms-->
      <section id="symptoms">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Leukemia symptoms often develop gradually but can also appear suddenly depending on the type. Common signs include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Persistent fatigue and weakness</li>
          <li>Frequent or severe infections</li>
          <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
          <li>Swollen lymph nodes, especially in the neck, armpits, or groin</li>

          <li>Combination drug regimens to kill rapidly dividing leukemia cells</li>
          <li>Induction, consolidation, and maintenance phases depending on leukemia type</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Bone Marrow/Stem Cell Transplant</h3>

          <li>Replaces diseased bone marrow with healthy stem cells</li>
          <li>Used in acute leukemias and relapsed cases</li>
          <li>Can provide potential cure but involves significant risks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Targeted Therapy & Immunotherapy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Drugs that target specific genetic mutations in leukemia cells (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors)</li>
          <li>Monoclonal antibodies and CAR T-cell therapy enhance immune response</li>
          <li>Important in chronic leukemias and relapsed cases</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Supportive Treatments</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Blood transfusions, antibiotics, and growth factors to manage side effects</li>
          <li>Psychosocial support for patients and families</li>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
        <p>
          In ancient cultures, leukemia was not recognized as a distinct disease. Symptoms such as fatigue and bleeding were often attributed to imbalances of humors or spirits. Treatments included herbal medicine, bloodletting, and spiritual healing, but lacked understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms.
