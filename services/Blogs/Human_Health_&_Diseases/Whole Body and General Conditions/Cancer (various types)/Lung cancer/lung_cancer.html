      <p>Lung cancer is a malignant tumor that starts in the lungs, caused by uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells. It is one of the most common and serious cancers worldwide. There are two main types: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), each requiring different treatment approaches. Early diagnosis improves chances of successful treatment.</p>
      <!-- Symptoms -->
      <section id="symptoms">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>

          <li>A persistent cough that does not go away or worsens</li>
          <li>Coughing up blood, even in small amounts</li>
          <li>Chest pain that is often worse with deep breathing, coughing, or laughing</li>

      <section id="causes">
        <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>

        <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Systemic treatment to kill cancer cells</li>
          <li>Used before or after surgery or as primary treatment in advanced stages</li>
          <li>Often combined with other treatments</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Radiation Therapy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Targeted radiation to destroy cancer cells</li>
          <li>Used in patients not eligible for surgery or for symptom control</li>
          <li>Includes stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for precise targeting</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Targeted Therapy & Immunotherapy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Drugs targeting specific genetic mutations (EGFR, ALK, ROS1) or pathways</li>
          <li>Immune checkpoint inhibitors help the immune system attack cancer cells</li>
          <li>Important options for advanced or metastatic cases</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Management of Symptoms and Complications</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Palliative care to manage pain, breathing difficulties, and other symptoms</li>
          <li>Procedures to relieve airway obstructions or fluid buildup around lungs</li>

          Historically, lung cancer was not well understood and treatments were limited to herbal remedies and symptom relief. Smoking was not recognized as a risk factor. Modern surgical, medical, and radiation techniques have vastly improved outcomes.
