    <p>Colorectal cancer develops from uncontrolled growth of cells in the colon or rectum, beginning often as benign polyps that may become malignant over time. It is a prevalent cancer with significant impact worldwide. Timely screening and comprehensive treatment are key to improving outcomes.</p>

    <!--Symptoms-->
    <section id="symptoms">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
      <p>Early colorectal cancer may show no symptoms. Signs to watch for include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blood in the stool or rectal bleeding</li>
        <li>Changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation, or narrowing stools</li>

    <section id="treatment">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Treatment Options</h2>

      <h3>Surgery</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Removal of cancerous section of the colon or rectum.</li>
        <li>May include removal of nearby lymph nodes.</li>
        <li>Colostomy or ileostomy may be necessary in some cases.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Chemotherapy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Systemic drug treatment used before surgery (neoadjuvant) or after surgery (adjuvant) to destroy cancer cells.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Radiation Therapy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells, particularly for rectal cancer or to shrink tumors pre-surgery.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Targeted & Immunotherapy</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Agents targeting specific cancer cell pathways or boosting immune response.</li>
        <li>Used in advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.</li>
      </ul>

    <!--Ancient Overview-->
    <section id="ancient_methods">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Historical Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Historically, colorectal cancer was recognized by symptoms like blood in stools and bowel changes. Early surgical attempts were crude and often ineffective. Modern screening methods and multimodal treatments have transformed colorectal cancer care dramatically.

      <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Supports for Colorectal Cancer</h2>
      <p>Alongside medical treatments, supportive natural approaches may enhance patient well-being:</p>

      <h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>High-fiber diet rich in fruits and vegetables supports digestive health.</li>
        <li>Maintain adequate hydration and balanced nutrition during treatment.</li>
