      <p>Pancreatic cancer arises when abnormal cells in the pancreas multiply uncontrollably. This aggressive disease is often detected late because it rarely causes early symptoms. With advances in treatment and early detection strategies, outcomes continue to improve for many patients[web:58][web:59].</p>

          <li>Newer, precise drugs target specific cancer mutations (e.g., EGFR, PARP inhibitors)</li>
          <li>Immunotherapy boosts the immune response against cancer cells</li>
          <li>Best for advanced or resistant cancers[web:58][web:60]</li>

          Classical medicine attempted to treat digestive complaints with herbal remedies, dietary restrictions, and topical poultices. True cancer of the pancreas was not identified until modern histology and imaging studies became available.
