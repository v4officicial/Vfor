        alt="ME/CFS diagnostic criteria">
    <p>Chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a multi‑system biological illness marked by profound fatigue not relieved by rest and a hallmark feature called post‑exertional malaise (PEM), where symptoms worsen after minimal physical, cognitive, or emotional effort and can be delayed by 12–48 hours.[web:33][web:25]</p>
   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Core diagnostic features include substantial reduction in function for at least 6 months, PEM, unrefreshing sleep, and cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance; additional symptoms can include pain, light/sound sensitivity, and flu‑like malaise.[web:25][web:33]</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Post‑exertional malaise: symptom exacerbation after activity, often delayed and lasting days or longer.[web:25][web:22]</li>
    <li>Unrefreshing sleep and circadian disturbances despite adequate time in bed.[web:25]</li>
    <li>Cognitive issues such as memory problems, slow processing, and “brain fog.”[web:25][web:33]</li>
    <li>Orthostatic intolerance, dizziness, palpitations, or POTS‑like symptoms when upright.[web:33]</li>
    <li>Widespread pain, headaches, and hypersensitivity to light and sound in many patients.[web:33]</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Causes of disease -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>The etiology is multifactorial with hypotheses involving immune dysregulation, autonomic and neuroendocrine abnormalities, mitochondrial dysfunction, and possible post‑infectious triggers; genetic and epigenetic factors may contribute.[web:27][web:21][web:35]</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Post‑viral onset reported after infections such as EBV or similar triggers in subsets.[web:24][web:33]</li>
        <li>Immune activation and altered cytokine signaling linked to symptom flares.[web:35][web:27]</li>
        <li>Neuroendocrine dysfunction including relative hypocortisolism and HPA axis changes.[web:21]</li>
        <li>Autonomic dysfunction leading to orthostatic intolerance and reduced energy capacity.[web:33]</li>
        <li>Potential genetic/epigenetic predisposition affecting stress and energy pathways.[web:21][web:31]</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<!-- Causes by Age Group -->
<section id="causes-children">
    <h3>Children</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Presentation includes PEM, cognitive issues, and school absenteeism; diagnosis uses the same core criteria adapted for age.[web:25]</li>
        <li>Care plans prioritize pacing, school accommodations, and sleep hygiene.[web:33]</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-adults">
    <h3>Adults</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Onset often follows an acute infection or major stressor; course fluctuates with relapses and remissions.[web:33][web:27]</li>
        <li>Coexisting conditions like orthostatic intolerance and sleep disorders are common and need targeted management.[web:33]</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section id="causes-aged">
    <h3>Aged People</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Less frequently newly diagnosed in older age; differential includes cardiopulmonary, endocrine, and sleep disorders.[web:27]</li>
        <li>Polypharmacy and comorbidities require careful medication review and tailored pacing.[web:27]</li>
    </ul>
</section>
<!--Precations-->
<section id="precautions">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> Precautions | Preventions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Adopt pacing and energy‑envelope management to avoid PEM, including cognitive and sensory pacing.[web:25][web:37]</li>
    <li>Prioritize sleep hygiene and consistent routines to reduce unrefreshing sleep burden.[web:39]</li>
    <li>Manage orthostatic intolerance with fluids, salt (if appropriate), compression, and positional strategies.[web:33]</li>
    <li>Structure activities with rests, minimize multitasking, and avoid “push‑crash” cycles.[web:37]</li>
    <li>Work with clinicians to identify and treat comorbid sleep, pain, and mood symptoms.[web:39][web:33]</li>

<!--Treatement-->
<section id="treatment">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-syringe" aria-hidden="true"></i> Management Options</h2>

  <h3>Symptom‑Targeted Care</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Sleep optimization, pain control, and orthostatic intolerance management tailored to individual profiles.[web:39][web:33]</li>
    <li>Careful, patient‑led activity planning rather than fixed graded exercise to prevent PEM.[web:22][web:37]</li>
    <li>Cognitive support strategies and environmental modifications for sensory overload.[web:33]</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Medications and Adjuncts</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Pharmacologic options target symptoms (sleep aids, pain modulators, OI treatments) rather than curing the illness.[web:39]</li>
    <li>Nutraceuticals like CoQ10 and NADH show preliminary benefit in small studies but evidence remains limited and heterogeneous.[web:23][web:26]</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Rehabilitation and Support</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Occupational therapy to structure energy‑efficient daily routines and accommodations.[web:39]</li>
    <li>Psychological support for coping skills; CBT may help with adjustment but is not curative.[web:27]</li>
  </ul>

<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Ancient Treatments</h2>
  <p>Historical descriptions of post‑infectious fatigue were managed with rest, tonics, and herbal preparations; modern frameworks emphasize biological underpinnings and tailored pacing rather than generalized exertion.[web:27]</p>

<!--Natural Remedies-->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for ME/CFS</h2>
  <p>Evidence for supplements is emerging but mixed; some patients report benefit with CoQ10, NADH, probiotics, and sleep supports, but rigorous trials are limited and results heterogeneous.[web:23][web:26]</p>

  <h3>Diet and Lifestyle Approaches</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Balanced anti‑inflammatory nutrition, hydration, and consistent meal timing to support energy stability.[web:27]</li>
    <li>Sleep hygiene: regular schedule, light control, and stimulant timing to reduce unrefreshing sleep.[web:39]</li>
    <li>Calm sensory environments and planned quiet periods to limit overload.[web:33]</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Supplements with Preliminary Signals</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Coenzyme Q10 and NADH may modestly reduce subjective fatigue in small studies.[web:23][web:26]</li>
    <li>Probiotics for gut‑immune modulation and symptom relief in some reports.[web:23]</li>
    <li>Melatonin or magnesium for sleep quality in selected individuals with provider guidance.[web:26]</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Additional Measures</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Mindfulness and gentle breathing for autonomic regulation without provoking PEM.[web:39]</li>
    <li>Compression garments and fluid/salt strategies for orthostatic intolerance where appropriate.[web:33]</li>
