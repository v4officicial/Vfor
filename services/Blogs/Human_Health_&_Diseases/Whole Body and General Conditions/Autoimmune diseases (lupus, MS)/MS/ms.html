    <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks the protective myelin sheath around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. This leads to communication problems between the brain and the body, causing a wide range of neurological symptoms. MS progresses with periods of relapse and remission or steady worsening, making early diagnosis and treatment essential.</p>
   
   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>MS symptoms differ based on the areas of the central nervous system affected:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fatigue, often severe and persistent</li>
    <li>Muscle weakness and spasms</li>
    <li>Numbness and tingling in limbs</li>
    <li>Difficulty with coordination and balance</li>
    <li>Vision problems such as blurred or double vision</li>
    <li>Cognitive impairment including memory and concentration issues</li>

<!-- Causes of disease -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>Multiple sclerosis arises from immune system malfunction but exact causes remain unclear:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Genetic susceptibility combined with environmental triggers</li>
        <li>Possible viral infections initiating immune response</li>
        <li>Vitamin D deficiency and smoking as risk factors</li>
        <li>Disruption of blood-brain barrier allowing immune cells to attack myelin</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Treatment of Relapses and Symptoms</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Corticosteroids for acute relapses to reduce inflammation.</li>
    <li>Medications for muscle spasms, fatigue, pain, and bladder problems.</li>
    <li>Physical and occupational therapy to improve mobility and function.</li>
    <li>Cognitive rehabilitation therapies for memory and mental function.</li>

<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Historical Context</h2>
  <p>
    Multiple sclerosis was first described in the 19th century. Earlier remedies included herbal anti-inflammatories and supportive care. Modern understanding of MS as an autoimmune disease has led to targeted immunotherapies and improved prognosis.
