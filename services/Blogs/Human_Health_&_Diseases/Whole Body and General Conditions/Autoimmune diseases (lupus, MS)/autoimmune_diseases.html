    <p>Autoimmune diseases occur when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's own tissues, leading to chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Common autoimmune diseases include systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus) and multiple sclerosis (MS). Early recognition and treatment are essential to manage these complex disorders and improve quality of life.</p>
   
   <!--Symptoms-->
   <section id="symptoms">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-notes-medical"></i> Symptoms</h2>
  <p>Symptoms of autoimmune diseases vary widely by condition but may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Fatigue and malaise</li>
    <li>Joint pain, swelling, and stiffness (common in lupus and rheumatoid arthritis)</li>
    <li>Muscle weakness and numbness (common in MS)</li>
    <li>Skin rashes, including butterfly rash on face (lupus)</li>
    <li>Blurred vision and difficulty with coordination (MS)</li>
    <li>Fever, weight loss, and swollen glands</li>
    <li>Organ-specific symptoms depending on affected tissues</li>
  </ul>

<!-- Causes of disease -->
<section id="causes">
    <h2><i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Causes</h2>
    <p>Autoimmune diseases arise from a complex interaction of genetic, environmental, and immune factors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Genetic predisposition including family history</li>
        <li>Environmental triggers such as infections, toxins, and UV exposure</li>
        <li>Hormonal influences particularly in women</li>
        <li>Immune system dysregulation leading to loss of self-tolerance</li>

<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Historical Treatments</h2>
  <p>
    In ancient medicine, autoimmune symptoms were often misattributed to imbalances or mystic causes. Herbal and natural remedies like turmeric, ginger, and willow bark were used for inflammation and pain. Modern advances have identified immune dysregulation as a cause and developed targeted therapies.

<!--Natural Remedies-->
<section id="natural_remedies">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Natural Remedies for Autoimmune Diseases</h2>
  <p>Natural approaches can support symptom management and overall wellness but do not replace medical treatment.</p>

  <h3>Diet and Lifestyle</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Anti-inflammatory diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, fruits, and vegetables.</li>
    <li>Regular moderate physical activity to improve strength and reduce fatigue.</li>
