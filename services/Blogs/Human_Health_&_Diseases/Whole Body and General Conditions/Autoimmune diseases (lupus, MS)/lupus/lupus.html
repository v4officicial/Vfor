<!--Ancient method of treatment-->
<section id="ancient_methods">
  <h2><i class="fas fa-landmark" aria-hidden="true"></i> Historical Perspectives</h2>
  <p>
    Lupus and autoimmune symptoms were historically misunderstood, often attributed to humoral imbalances or mysticism. Herbal remedies and natural anti-inflammatories like turmeric and willow bark were used. Modern medicine has clarified the autoimmune basis and developed targeted treatments.
