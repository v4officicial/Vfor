        <p>
          Ancient medical texts recommend herbal poultices, wound cleansing with natural antiseptics, and massages to stimulate blood flow. Ayurveda prescribed the use of turmeric, neem, and honey for wound healing. Traditional Chinese medicine applied acupuncture and herbal compresses to improve circulation and skin regeneration. These methods historically complemented modern wound care.
